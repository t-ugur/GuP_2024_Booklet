\section*{How do I get to the venue?}

In general, we recommend the “Naldo” app, which will show you all the bus times in real time. Additionally, you can find all the bus lines online at https://www.swtue.de/oepnv/fahrplan-und-liniennetz/fahrplaene.html .

The closest bus stop to the venue is called “BG Unfallklinik” and is served by bus lines 5, 13, 14, 17, 18. Central bus stops in the city center are “Hauptbahnhof” (served by all bus lines), “Neckarbrücke” (served by 5, 13, 17, 18) and “Wilhelmstraße” (served by 5, 13, 17, 18).

If you stay in Reutlingen, train MEX 12, MEX 18, IRE 6 and RB 63 will bring you within 10 minutes to the main station in Tübingen. A train departs every half an hour.

\section*{What is a good place to eat and drink in Tübingen?}

Tübingen has a few nice cafés, restaurants and bars to offer. Coffee places with a nice atmosphere are Café Haag, Café Hanseatica, Willi Tübingen, Suedhang Kaffee and Katesch.
For authentic Swabian food, we recommend Krumme Brücke, Mauganeschtle, Marquardtei, Weinstube Forelle, Ratskeller and Wurstküche. The Neckarmüller is a nice beergarden and the Bären serves Swabian tapas! The Bären and Ratskeller are nice places to stay for one or a few more beers. Other good bars are the Jäger, Stadtpost, Chez Michel and the Irish pub Saints and Scholars.


\section*{And if I need money?}

Contactless payment is available almost everywhere, but some bars still rely on cash. You can find the nearest ATM close to the venue at the BG Klinik at Schnarrenbergstraße.
