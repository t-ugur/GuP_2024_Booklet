            Our Posterblitz Symposium offers a stage for the early-career members. Here, innovative research projects by early-career scientists are presented to as broad a professional audience as possible. Specifically, each person gives a short "lightning-style" presentation, followed by a few minutes of questions. Among the submissions, we, the early-career members of the DGPA and the DGPs Division of Biological Psychology and Neuropsychology, will select the best abstracts which were submitted results-blind. Our evaluation criteria are: Report of effect sizes, clarity of presentation, study design, and theoretical derivation of hypotheses. We look forward to your exciting talks!
