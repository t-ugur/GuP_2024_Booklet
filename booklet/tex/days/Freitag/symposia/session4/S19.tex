            Perceiving unexpected events is an important function of human perception and of utmost importance for survival. In an experimental setting, a mismatch between expected input and presented stimulus is often accompanied by an increase in processing and/or brain activation (= mismatch response). In the current symposium, results of new studies investigating such mismatch responses in audition, vision and somatosensation will be presented. The talks will cover a wide area of applied methods like electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as behavioral measures. In the first talk, Jana Harenbrock will focus on how auditory mismatch responses measured with EEG are moderated by awareness and task relevance. In the second talk, Nina Coy will shed light on how the predictive potential of auditory deviants influences mismatch responses like mismatch negativity, P3a and behavioral measures. In the third talk, Insa Schlossmacher will address underlying mechanisms of visual mismatch responses measured by EEG as well as fMRI. In the fourth talk, Miro Grundei will examine mismatch responses across vision, audition and somatosensation using computational modeling and connectivity analysis of EEG and fMRI data. In the last talk, Kaja Loock will take up the topic of predictive processing by investigating how prediction errors elicited in a fear-conditioning paradigm influence episodic memory formation. Taken together this symposium will present new and impactful findings elucidating moderators and underlying mechanisms of mismatch responses.
