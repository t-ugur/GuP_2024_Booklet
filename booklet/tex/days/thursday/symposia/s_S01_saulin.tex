    % Prosocial behavior is ubiquitous in daily life and has been a longstanding subject of investigation in social and biological psychology. Nevertheless, factors that promote prosocial, i.e., helping behavior and factors that may hinder such behavior are strongly debated. Recently, meta-analyses, reviews, and explicit tests of determinants and influences on prosocial behavior on the process and neural level have been performed, making the research of prosocial behavior more and more versatile.This symposium brings together pre- and postdoctoral scientists from three countries (Austria, Germany, and UK) and five different universities (Vienna, Dresden, Würzburg, Royal Holloway London, \& Lübeck) who adopt different perspectives to investigate prosocial behavior and its neurophysiological correlates.In more detail, our symposium provides insights into the neural basis of prosocial behavior as assessed by economic games (Gabriele Bellucci) and sheds light on how different types of stress are linked to such prosocial behavior and endocrinological markers (Jonas Nitschke). We will discuss the role of self-control in prosocial decision-making of participants with narcissistic personality disorder (David S. Stolz) and how everyday prosocial behavior is associated with empathy and well-being across the adult lifespan (Lena Pollerhoff). A final presentation will elucidate the influence of financial incentives on prosocial and fairness-based behavior combining fMRI and computational models (Anne Saulin).Together, the presentations of the invited experts provide insights into different approaches to study determinants of prosocial behavior. Using these different methodologies, the contributions demonstrate how various behavioral and physiological indicators can be leveraged to study the complex phenomenon of prosocial behavior.
