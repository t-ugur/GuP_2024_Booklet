\section*{How do I get to the venue?}

The Bürgerhaus Wilhelmsburg (Mengestraße 20, 21107 Hamburg) is just a 5-min walk from Wilhelmsburg train station that can be reached via S-Bahn lines 3 and 5 (from the city center in the direction of Hamburg Neugraben and Stade/Buxtehude, respectively). Trains leave every 5-10 minutes. 
The bus station Rathaus Wilhelmsburg is right next to the venue. 
Limited free parking is also available.

We recommend the HVV- and Stadtrad-Apps for getting around in Hamburg.

\section*{What is a good place to eat and drink in Hamburg?}

% Tübingen has a few nice cafés, restaurants and bars to offer. Coffee places with a nice atmosphere are Café Haag, Café Hanseatica, Willi Tübingen, Suedhang Kaffee and Katesch.
% For authentic Swabian food, we recommend Krumme Brücke, Mauganeschtle, Marquardtei, Weinstube Forelle, Ratskeller and Wurstküche. The Neckarmüller is a nice beergarden and the Bären serves Swabian tapas! The Bären and Ratskeller are nice places to stay for one or a few more beers. Other good bars are the Jäger, Stadtpost, Chez Michel and the Irish pub Saints and Scholars.


\section*{And if I need money?}

% Contactless payment is available almost everywhere, but some bars still rely on cash. You can find the nearest ATM close to the venue at the BG Klinik at Schnarrenbergstraße.
