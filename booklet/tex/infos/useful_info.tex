\section*{How do I get to the venue?}

The Bürgerhaus Wilhelmsburg (Mengestraße 20, 21107 Hamburg) is a 12-min walk from Wilhelmsburg train station that can be reached via S-Bahn lines 3 and 5 (from the city center in the direction of Hamburg Neugraben and Stade/Buxtehude, respectively). Trains leave every 5-10 minutes. 
The bus station Rathaus Wilhelmsburg is right next to the venue. The bus 13 (sometimes also 152 and 154) go there from the train station.
Limited free parking is also available.

We recommend the HVV- and Stadtrad-Apps for getting around in Hamburg.

% \section*{What is a good place to eat and drink in Hamburg?}

% Tübingen has a few nice cafés, restaurants and bars to offer. Coffee places with a nice atmosphere are Café Haag, Café Hanseatica, Willi Tübingen, Suedhang Kaffee and Katesch.
% For authentic Swabian food, we recommend Krumme Brücke, Mauganeschtle, Marquardtei, Weinstube Forelle, Ratskeller and Wurstküche. The Neckarmüller is a nice beergarden and the Bären serves Swabian tapas! The Bären and Ratskeller are nice places to stay for one or a few more beers. Other good bars are the Jäger, Stadtpost, Chez Michel and the Irish pub Saints and Scholars.


% \section*{And if I need money?}

% Contactless payment is available almost everywhere, but some bars still rely on cash. You can find the nearest ATM close to the venue at the BG Klinik at Schnarrenbergstraße.
