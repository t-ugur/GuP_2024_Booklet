\section*{Welcome aboard!}

We look forward to welcoming you to the social evening on Friday at Cap San Diego (7 pm – 2 am)! This iconic ship, docked in Hamburg, provides a unique maritime atmosphere for our event.

The entrance to the social evening begins directly after the conference program at 7 pm. Enjoy an international vegan and vegetarian buffet. Eight complimentary drinks are included in the ticket price.

At 10 pm, we will present the Poster prizes, the IGOR prize, and the award for best supervision. Regrettably, we must inform you that the PuG Band had to cancel their performance this year. Nevertheless, we are confident that the evening will still be an excellent opportunity for exchange and enjoyment, with a live DJ ensuring a vibrant end to the night.

Students and PhD students can purchase a party ticket for 40€, allowing entry from 9:30 pm, including four complimentary drinks.

Join us for an evening of networking, entertainment, and culinary delights at Cap San Diego! 

\textbf{Please be advised that ONLY CASH payments will be accepted on board!}
