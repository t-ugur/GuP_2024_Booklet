Using a large sample of participants (n = 156), across four diagnostic groups including obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and a naturalistic control group, we examined the influence of disorder category, clinical status, family risk, and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions (anxious apprehension and anxious arousal). The research objectives and methodology were preregistered prior to data collection (https://osf.io/kxv5h) and the dataset as well as the analytic code have been deposited in an OSF repository (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/7DCM3). Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not observe significant ERN or CRN differences among the diagnostic groups. However, when compared to a strictly defined healthy control group, individuals with specific phobia exhibited a larger ERN, a novel finding. In line with previous work, individuals with a lifetime clinical diagnosis of any internalizing disorder or with a family risk for internalizing psychopathology showed larger ERN and CRN amplitudes. After combining our data with a subclinical sample (n = 246), we identified gender as a moderator, with women exhibiting higher levels of anxious apprehension showing an elevated ERN and CRN. In conclusion, our study challenges the notion of a disorder-specific link to performance monitoring. Instead, our findings suggest that enhanced performance monitoring is associated with a higher propensity for anxious apprehension and acts as a broad risk marker for internalizing psychopathology, reflecting vulnerability beyond diagnostic borders within the anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive spectrum.'},\n",

Here, we present two studies focusing on different applications of these psychophysiological markers. In study 1, an executive control training targeting the error-related negativity (ERN) was applied in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies have shown that the robust increase of the ERN in OCD might reflect a risk marker and that it persists after cognitive-behavioral therapy despite successful symptom reduction, thus possibly demanding for specifically-tailored interventions. Results of study 1 showed a slight reduction of the ERN and OCD symptoms after the three-week executive control training thus strengthening its potential as a target for augmentative interventions. Study 2 focused on the potential contributions of psychophysiological markers for the diagnostic classification of problematic internet use (PIU). As PIU exhibits features of behavioral addiction but is also associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms its placement across the internalizing-externalizing spectrum is currently being discussed. Thus, psychophysiological markers of performance monitoring (ERN), reward processing (reward-related positivity, rewP), and inhibition (N2, P300) were assessed and results were compared to established patterns in addiction vs. internalizing disorders. Across all three tasks the results of study 2 rather favor the classification of PIU as an internalizing disorder. Taken together, the two studies illustrate the potential for application of the mechanistic insights derived from cross-sectional psychophysiological studies in additional areas of clinical research such as the development of novel interventions and diagnostic classification.'},\n",

The majority of patients with OCD engage in repetitive checking, which might be a phenotypic expression of increased error monitoring. To test a causal link between checking behavior and the ERN, a preregistered, randomized-controlled design was employed. First, the baseline (T0) ERN of N = 90 university students was measured via electroencephalography during an Eriksen Flanker Task. Then, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: While an experimental group (n = 30) was instructed to repetitively check kitchen devices in a virtual reality (VR) environment, an active control group (n = 30) waited in the same VR environment, and a passive control group (n = 30) waited without a VR headset. Subsequently (T1), the ERN was assessed again. The checking induction resulted in an increased ERN after symptom induction (T1) in the experimental group compared with the active control group. This effect was specific to the ERN, as no differences in the correct-related negativity (CRN) emerged. Repetitive Checking in a virtual environment seems to impact the ERN, in line with previous cross-sectional studies. This finding implies that checking compulsions, which are highly prevalent among patients with OCD, might be a phenotypic expression of an increased ERN. Future studies could extend these findings to clinical samples with OCD.'},\n",

In this simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, we investigate the role of personal relevance in emotional face processing in ASC. Participants with ASC and matched controls (N=46) performed an emotion recognition task including a personally relevant person and a matched stranger, displaying fearful, happy, and neutral facial expressions. Both groups showed significantly increased hemodynamic activity for relevant vs. stranger’s faces in the core and extended face processing network, including fusiform gyrus, medial PFC and precuneus. Crucially, emotion effects in ASC were limited to relevant faces, while the control group showed emotion effects for both relevant and unknown faces. In EEG data, increased P1 amplitudes to relevant vs. stranger’s faces were observed only for the non-autistic group, while later effects (P3) were present for both groups. In addition, cross-modal representational similarity analyses (RSA) analyses revealed that significant shared representations between EEG and fMRI data at sensory stages were again limited to the control group. Our results indicate that face processing in ASC seems to be characterised by a higher specificity, rather than a general dysfunction. Furthermore, EEG data revealed differences in the temporal profile of face processing, where modulations at sensory stages were limited to the control group. Our results speak to the importance of using individualized stimuli and multi-modal analyses in order to allow for the investigation of real-life social information processing in clinical populations.'},\n",

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an effective treatment for OCD, yet a significant number of patients do not sufficiently respond to intervention. In line with recent advances in individualized medicine approaches, neurocognitive biomarkers could help identify individuals at risk for non-response and provide insight into underlying mechanisms. Here, we examined whether the late positive potential (LPP), a neural correlate of emotional reactivity, could serve as a prospective predictor of therapy response in patients with OCD (n = 100). Results indicated gender-moderated prediction of therapy response by LPP to unpleasant and pleasant emotional pictures. That is, female patients with relatively higher reactivity to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli were more likely to benefit from CBT, possibly through lower emotional avoidance. Moreover, findings from the same sample suggest that higher resting heart-rate-variability (HRV) also is a predictor of greater symptom reduction through CBT, particularly in female patients with OCD. As HRV has been discussed as a marker of flexible implicit emotion regulation, these findings align to indicate that both biological measures of emotional responsivity can serve as clinical prognostic markers in OCD, with blunting in responsivity being predictive of higher risk for non-response to CBT. Implications of these findings with respect to the clinical utility of such markers and further directions will be discussed.'}}}"
