Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the processing of emotional information remains largely intact. We therefore tried to investigate whether older adults benefit from emotional feedback in a probabilistic learning task and if these advantages are reflected in feedback-locked event-related-potentials. Twenty older (65-76 years) and 17 younger (19-27 years) adults performed a stimulus-response association task in which they learned via positive (happy faces) and negative (disgusted faces) emotional feedback. To examine whether participants would benefit from emotional information during learning, strong vs. mild emotional expressions were contrasted. Preliminary findings indicate superior learning in younger adults compared to older adults, with both groups showing improved learning after emotional feedback. Interestingly, with strong emotional feedback, older adults achieved a comparable level of accuracy as younger adults in the mild emotional condition. On an electrophysiological level, older adults exhibited an enlarged peak-to-peak FRN after mild emotional feedback compared to strong emotional feedback. We assume that the mild emotional feedback may have been more difficult to extract for them so that larger expectancy violations occurred. Regarding the mean P3b, our results suggest stronger working memory updating for older adults, particularly in response to strong negative emotional feedback, probably mediating better learning in this condition. In contrast, younger adults exhibited stronger updating in response to negative feedback, independently of the strength of emotional information.","Submitter first name":"Jana Isabelle","Submitter last name":"Braunwarth","Submitter (affiliation)":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","Submitter (email)":"braunwarth@uni-wuppertal.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"1":{"Id":8,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Open, Reproducible and Meta Science","Title":"MOTION-BIDS: extending the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification to organize motion data for reproducible research","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"The extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data (Motion-BIDS) aims to standardize the organization of motion data for reproducible research in human brain and behavioral studies.

Since motivation is known to influence a variety of cognitive processes, the present study aimed at identifying whether electrophysiological indices of feedback processing can be influenced by different motivational instructions. For this reason, participants were split into two instructional groups, a gain (n=22) and loss (n=20) group. In the gain group instructions highlighted that money could be gained for obtaining positive feedback, while in the loss group, losing money for obtaining negative feedback was stressed. Both groups performed a time estimation task. To be able to investigate feedback expectedness and valence, feedback was manipulated to occur at a rate of 20% each for positive and negative and 60% for neutral feedback. Across groups we replicated previous research demonstrating that the peak-to-peak FRN was sensitive to the detection of positive and negative expectancy violations. There were no differences in peak-to-peak FRN between the two instructional groups. However, our preliminary results suggest a significant influence of motivational instruction on working memory updating after feedback receipt as reflected in the P3b. Specifically, we found an enhanced P3b for positive feedback in the gain group, indicating that an instruction suggesting a focus on positive feedback can result in stronger working memory updating after this type of feedback. This indicates that motivational focus can affect the later stages of feedback processing.","Submitter first name":"Anna Teresa","Submitter last name":"Kl\u00e4ser","Submitter (affiliation)":"Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal","Submitter (email)":"klaeser@uni-wuppertal.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"3":{"Id":10,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Pharmacological enhancement of dopamine neurotransmission does not affect illusory pattern perception","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Delusional belief and psychotic symptoms have been linked to dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy and clinical samples and are conceived of as resulting at least partly from perceiving illusory patterns in noise.

In a three-day fMRI study, we show that post-retrieval stress impairs subsequent memory depending on the strength of neural reinstatement of the original memory trace during reactivation, driven by the hippocampus and its crosstalk with neocortical representation areas. Comparison of neural patterns during immediate and final memory testing further revealed that successful retrieval was linked to pattern-dissimilarity in controls, suggesting the use of a different trace, whereas stressed participants relied on the original memory representation.

Specifically, training of processing speed tasks has shown promising effects for improving cognitive functioning in adults. These training-related changes are often studied using reaction times and error rates which provide limited insight into mechanisms underlying changes and plasticity during training. The drift-diffusion model provides estimates of the cognitive processes underlying speeded decision tasks, such as the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), response strategies (boundary separation), and processes such as stimulus encoding and motor response (non-decision time). We applied this model to data of a multi-session training study (von Bastian & Oberauer, 2013). Thirty adult participants performed 20 training sessions over the course of four weeks, with three matching tasks each session: face-, pattern-, and digit-matching. Across all tasks, our results show that drift rates increased throughout processing speed training, while boundary separation and non-decision time decreased during the beginning of training. Improvements in drift rate might be a sign of plasticity induced by processing speed training, whereas changes in boundary separation suggest an adjustment in response strategy.

Research suggests that ToM sophistication varies across different interactional contexts; in competitive situations, individuals tend to reason at a higher ToM level to anticipate and counteract opponents' strategic choices. Conversely, in cooperative scenarios requiring action coordination, a mental model predicting the partner's actions based on their perception can be advantageous.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore whether transitioning between interactional contexts prompts changes in ToM levels or maintains sophistication, we designed a novel Social Foraging Task (SFT).

Apart from their pure bottom-up processing, focusing selective attention to one specific emotional expression (e.g., angry, happy) should activate an attentional template which biases neural activity toward target features. Thereby, it should further improve the discrimination of emotional target faces at early stages. This general idea has been supported by research on emotional words and was investigated using naturalistic emotional faces; however, for faces no early attention-modulated expression effects were found (P1, N170). One reason for this failure could be too much interstimulus variability in naturalistic faces, which hindered the representation of an accurate visual template of the target expression.\n\n\nWe therefore employed an expression detection task using artificial faces with similar and dissimilar face features (10% vs. 40% variance regarding symmetrical features) in this pre-registered study. Participants had to react only to one, block-wise predefined, target expression in a randomized stream of happy, neutral and angry faces, seeing similar and dissimilar faces in three blocks each.\n\n\nResults from the current sample (N = 40) revealed ERP effects of expression at four components (P1, N170, EPN, LPP) using Linear Mixed Models. For all components, the respective expression effect was modulated by status, being larger in target faces. Effects of face similarity emerged at later components (EPN, LPP) indicating stronger modulation of the expression effect in similar faces. These results suggest that already at early stages attentional and face-related factors may influence the processing of (artificial) emotional expressions.","Submitter first name":"Jonas","Submitter last name":"Schmuck","Submitter (affiliation)":"Universit\u00e4t Bonn","Submitter (email)":"jschmuck@uni-bonn.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"239":{"Id":82,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Brain and Periphery, Neuroendocrinology, and Stress","Title":"Activation of the pain matrix during self-referential pain imagination","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"In clinical assessments and pain therapy, patients are asked to imagine themselves in pain.

(2020), 8 minutes of resting-state EEG before and after unrelated tasks with both eyes open and closed were analyzed using support vector regressions (SVR). A 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy between the spectral power of 59 EEG electrodes within 30 frequency bins ranging from 1 to 30 Hz and Big Five personality trait scores. We were not able to replicate the findings for Agreeableness. We extended the analysis by parameterizing the total EEG signal into its periodic and aperiodic signal components. However, neither component was meaningfully associated with the Big Five personality traits. Our results do not support the initial results and indicate that personality traits may at least not be substantially predictable from resting-state spectral power. Future identification of robust and replicable brain-personality associations will likely require alternative analysis methods and rigorous preregistration of all analysis steps.","Submitter first name":"Christoph","Submitter last name":"Fr\u00fchlinger","Submitter (affiliation)":"Universit\u00e4t Hamburg","Submitter (email)":"christoph.fruehlinger@uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"245":{"Id":88,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"Causal inference in visual and olfactory multisensory perception","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Introduction:\u00a0\u00a0For an accurate percept of the environment, the brain should integrate and segregate multisensory signals from common and independent causes.

Our study demonstrates that following acute stress, the DMN and FPN transition towards transmodal processing while diverging from the SN, potentially facilitating acute stress consolidation. The SN shifts towards somatomotor processing, potentially enhancing action preparation. Overall, our findings demonstrate changes in network interactions using functional cortical gradients following acute stress.","Submitter first name":"Agata","Submitter last name":"Patyczek","Submitter (affiliation)":"Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kognitions- und Neurowissenschaften","Submitter (email)":"patyczek@cbs.mpg.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"257":{"Id":104,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Disorders and Interventions","Title":"Emotion regulation in adolescents with major depression \u2013 A combined EEG and eye-tracking study","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) are an important factor contributing to the development and maintenance of major depression (MD) in adolescents.

During the experiment, self-reported affective responses, the Late Positive Potential (LPP) and visual attention to emotional picture aspects were recorded simultaneously.\u00a0\n\n\nOn self-report level, adolescents with MD showed a reduced ER success compared to the healthy control group. Interestingly, both groups demonstrated an increase in LPP amplitudes in the middle LPP window when applying the adaptive ER strategy. Larger LPP amplitudes during ER were paralleled by more positive responses in self-report, but only in the control group.\n\n\nThe increase in LPP amplitudes during ER in both, the MD and healthy control group could depict a unique neurophysiological pattern that is characteristic to adolescence. This could suggest that ER is more challenging during this developmental stage and might require more cognitive resources.

This study investigates the long-term effects of VPT\/VLBW birth on cognitive control in adults aged 26. In a multimodal approach, we analyse a subset of the data from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study comprising 67 VPT\/VLBW and 81 full-term (FT) individuals. We derive a latent variable of cognitive control and compare it between VPT\/VLBW and FT adults. Additionally, we examine the structural brain network topology of the cognitive control system using graph theoretical parameters. ADHD symptom severity is considered as a moderating factor throughout the analysis. Anticipated outcomes include diminished cognitive control in VPT\/VLBW adults, along with alterations in the network topology characterized by increased segregation and reduced node centrality. Higher ADHD symptom severity is expected to correlate with poorer cognitive control and altered network topology across both groups.

Therefore, we investigated 42 healthy young (mean age: 23 years) and 39 healthy older (mean age: 68 years) adults with a novel paradigm allowing us to disentangle the effects of curiosity and surprise at encoding on subsequent free recall. While curiosity enhanced free recall in young and older adults, the effect was more pronounced in the older group (interaction). Further, in young adults surprise enhanced free recall in the low curiosity condition but it reduced recall in the high curiosity condition (interaction), which is compatible with a quadratic effect of arousal on memory performance. In older adults, surprise had no significant effect on free recall in the low or high curiosity condition. Taken together, curiosity can enhance free recall across the adult lifespan, but the effects of surprise vanish with age.","Submitter first name":"Nico","Submitter last name":"Bunzeck","Submitter (affiliation)":"Universit\u00e4t L\u00fcbeck ","Submitter (email)":"nico.bunzeck@uni-luebeck.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"273":{"Id":120,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"Noise suppression through attention and action","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Goal-oriented behaviour requires selective attention.

The present study investigated whether salivary testosterone levels in women with BPD were indicative of specific symptoms associated with BPD. Based on the known link between testosterone and dominance, we hypothesized an association of higher testosterone levels with externalizing, aggressive or impulsive behaviour, potentially leading to higher burden of interpersonal reactivity and conflict.\n\n\n**Methods**: Saliva levels were collected from 98 women with BPD (average age in years: 28, range 18-46). Afterwards, self-rating scales were administered to assess BPD (Borderline Symptom Checklist, BSL23) and depressive symptoms (Becks Depression Inventory, BDI-II). Regression analyses targeted associations between individual testosterone levels and BSL23 and BDI-II scores. Additionally, by-item-analyses were performed with Bonferroni corrections applied to control for the resulting multiple comparisons.\n\n\n**Results**: Higher testosterone levels were associated with higher overall disease burden indicated by BSL23 and BDI-II sum scores. When analyzed by item, higher testosterone levels were significantly associated with increased feelings of senselessness, self-disgust, pessimism, sense of failure and dislike of self.\n\n\n**Conclusion**: Our findings confirm that in women with BPD higher testosterone levels are positively associated with increased borderline and depressive symptomatology.

We focused on the traits extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, analyzing participants' responses to faces deemed as prototypical for each trait. Participants were asked to classify prototypical faces as above or below average representative of a certain trait, and then provide an interaction preference rating while face-sensitive event-related potentials, N170 and late positive potential (LPP), were measured.

The preference for agreeable faces correlated with personality characteristics of the perceiver. The higher a persons\u2019 score on trait agreeableness, the higher the preference ratings for prototypical and perceived high agreeable faces, as well as for any prototypical neuroticism face. An increase in preference ratings for prototypical agreeable faces was paralleled by an increase of the LPP.

Furthermore, the process of attentional exploration is shaped by learning, which tends to be selective towards more accurate predictors of an event. In order to investigate the diverse facets of fear acquisition and extinction on the interaction of attentional and learning processes, we created a novel multiple-cue paradigm. Initially, participants were presented with single visual cues (threat, safety, and ambiguous) in a series, each differing in their predictiveness for an aversive electrotactile stimulus. In randomly interspersed multiple-cue displays (ambiguous cues together with either threat or safety cues) were presented to investigate whether attentional exploration is biased towards the predictive components of the display or influenced primarily by the threat value. In the second half of the experiment, to examine the readjustment of expectations, associations between cues and outcomes were switched (reversal learning). Apart from assessing visual exploration, we collected shock expectancy ratings and autonomic data on trial-by-trial basis to investigate the involvement of attentional processes to aversive learning.

Therefore, we used a previously established paradigm in combination with psychopharmacology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a double-blind, placebo controlled, between-subjects design (n=88), administering a DA agonist (bromocriptine, 1.25 mg) and a DA antagonist (sulpiride, 400 mg). At the behavioural level, both the DA agonist and antagonist reduced the congruence effect, which is in line with the notion of an inverted u-shaped relationship between DA-levels and memory performance. At the neural level, similar patterns, i.e. a modulation of the congruence effect and subsequent memory effect by drug, has been observed in the dopaminergic midbrain, angular gyrus and PFC. As such, our findings give novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of schema dependent memory formation by demonstrating that dopamine modulates behaviour via neural activity changes in mesolimbic and prefrontal brain regions.","Submitter first name":"Mushfa","Submitter last name":"Yousuf","Submitter (affiliation)":"Mushfa Yousuf","Submitter (email)":"mus.yousuf@uni-luebeck.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"283":{"Id":131,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Affective Neuroscience","Title":"Impact of restrictive eating\/dieting on coding of subjective preferences for edible and non-edible rewards in the event-related potential (ERP)","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Previous research has linked brain activity as measured in the event-related potential (ERP) in the time window spanning the ERP components P2, feedback-related negativity (FRN), and P300 to coding of subjective reward preferences and subjective reward value.

Interestingly, for non-edible rewards, preference coding was less distinctive, with reduced differentiation especially of medium and low preference rewards. Contrary to expectations, only subtle differences between the diet and non-diet group emerged. Preliminary analyses pointed to increased FRN for high preference edible rewards in the diet group, and stronger preference coding for non-edible rewards compared to the non-diet group. Taken together, these results show that neural coding of subjective reward preferences is more distinctive for primary compared to secondary rewards.

The cognitive domains of attention, cognitive load and working memory are particularly relevant, each of which is reflected in characteristic oscillatory response patterns. However, perception research is mainly conducted in conventional laboratories, where stimuli are presented as 2D images on monitors in rather distanced settings. As a complementary method in the lab, virtual reality (VR) enables the presentation of life-size 3D stimuli, creating an experience with self-referential and immersive value close to real life. In a standard perception paradigm with two object categories differences in the induced alpha and theta band responses are compared between a standard 2D monitor and a realistic immersive VR setting. No evidence was found for differences in general attention between the 2D conditions and the realistic virtual conditions in electrode space, as posterior alpha suppression did not differ between conditions. However, source analysis suggests differences in the engaged attention networks for 2D and 3D perception. Midfrontal theta was significantly stronger in laboratory conditions, indicating higher cognitive load than in the VR environment. Exploratory analysis of posterior theta showed stronger responses in VR, possibly reflecting the processing of depth information provided only by the 3D material. In addition, the theta response appears to be generated by distinct neuronal sources under realistic conditions that differ from laboratory conditions.","Submitter first name":"Merle","Submitter last name":"Sagehorn","Submitter (affiliation)":"Merle Sagehorn","Submitter (email)":"merle.sagehorn@uni-osnabrueck.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"291":{"Id":139,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"(Brain) Stimulation","Title":"The role of stimulation order in transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation: Novel insights from a sustained attention task.","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Sustained attention, our ability to keep focus on a task for longer periods, is associated with the Locus coeruleus - Noradrenaline (LC-NA) system.

After pharmacological intervention, participants started a virtual path integration task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task included an environment with either no spatial cues or with a landmark to distinguish between pure path integration and landmark-supported path integration. Cortisol impaired path integration performance in both conditions and led participants to navigate farther away from the landmark. Moreover, cortisol altered activity in brain regions associated spatial navigation. Altogether, we provide evidence for cortisol-induced impairments of path integration in humans that may shed light into stress-hormone associated deficits in spatial navigation.","Submitter first name":"Osman","Submitter last name":"Akan","Submitter (affiliation)":"Osman Akan","Submitter (email)":"osman.akan@rub.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"295":{"Id":144,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Shaping perceptual decision formation by GABA-A and NMDA receptor manipulation","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Two neurotransmitter receptors are implicated in the accumulation of evidence for decision\n\n\nformation: N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-A\n\n\nreceptors.

Empathic stress occurs when individuals witness others in stressful situations and consequently experience stress themselves. Studying the impact of attachment on empathic stress can uncover factors that predispose or, else, protect against the experience of empathic stress. We hypothesized that empathic stress resonance would vary based on the empathic agent\u2019s attachment. Methods: The Trier Social Stress Test was conducted to induce psychosocial stress in one partner (here referred to as \"target\"), while the other partner acted as a passive observer of the stressful situation. We measured stress reactivity in both partners using salivary cortisol release, heart rate, heart rate variability, and self-report questionnaires. The observer's attachment representation was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview. Results: Our findings showed that the observer's cortisol resonance (the extent to which their cortisol release was proportional to that of the target) varied depending on their attachment representation. Securely attached individuals demonstrated higher levels of cortisol resonance as compared to those with an insecure-dismissing attachment. Discussion: These results suggest that securely attached individuals are more attuned to their partner's physiological experience during stressful situations, potentially enabling them to provide understanding and support. However, their heightened susceptibility to resonate with their partners\u2019 adverse experience may increase their risk of experiencing elevated stress levels themselves.

The goal of this study was to understand the neural dynamics involved in belief formation and updating. Here, we used high-density electroencephalogram recordings to constrain and temporally dissociate prior beliefs from the visual input to investigate the neural correlates of flexible integration of prior beliefs in visual decisions. We established a novel behavioral paradigm that combines reversal learning with a difficult motion discrimination task at perceptual threshold.

We compare the transformation of the prior belief when motion is congruent or incongruent with the prior belief until a motor decision is made. These results elucidate the neurophysiological basis of the influence of priors during evidence accumulation of perceptual stimuli during uncertainty. Future analyses will investigate if these dynamics account for individual differences in learning under volatile environments.","Submitter first name":"Gabriela","Submitter last name":"Iwama","Submitter (affiliation)":"Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of T\u00fcbingen","Submitter (email)":"gabriela.iwama@student.uni-tuebingen.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"305":{"Id":154,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Insular Gray Matter Volume explains Substance-Related Problems Beyond the Degree of Substance Use","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Altered frontal, striatal, and insular gray matter volumes (GMV) is frequently reported in substance use disorder (SUD).

This investigation utilizes neural network word embeddings, a form of distributional semantic models (DSMs), to investigate the formation of false memories within the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Neural network word embeddings serve as effective DSMs by encapsulating semantic relationships based on context similarity - words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, thus providing a computational framework for modeling memory phenomena. By analyzing semantic networks and using the mean vector of word lists as a semantic centroid, we seek to uncover the processes through which associative word lists may lead to false memories. The methodology confirms the relevance of lure words and word lists within the DRM paradigm, highlighting differences in semantic cohesion and domain-specificity. Further, employing representational similarity analysis (RSA), we compare the representational geometry of neural responses, captured through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, to that of word embeddings from DSMs. This comparison extends previous research by offering a more nuanced understanding of the alignment between brain activity and computational models of language. This investigation not only advances our theoretical knowledge of false memories but also forges a link between computational linguistics and neuroscience. It illuminates the semantic foundations of memory inaccuracies, providing valuable insights for the development of more sophisticated models of human memory.","Submitter first name":"Samuel","Submitter last name":"Sander","Submitter (affiliation)":"Central Institute of Mental Health","Submitter (email)":"samuel.sander@zi-mannheim.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"307":{"Id":156,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Altered interoceptive processing following bilateral amygdala damage \u2013 a dynamic functional connectivity analysis of fMRI data","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Urbach-Wiethe Disease (UWD) is a very rare genetic disorder that is often accompanied by a circumscribed bilateral calcification of the amygdala.

In this paradigm, patients were administered the compound isoproterenol which leads to a fast and transient increase in heart rate.

The resulting loss of attention has implications for aviation safety. Nevertheless, this concept has not been studied much in aviation research.\n\n\nIn the present study, we let 31 participants perform a 90-minute simulated flight with low but constant cognitive demand. The participants changed headings in accordance with an adapted 1-back task, and monitored and corrected the altitude of the aircraft if necessary. We assessed the emergence of subjective mind wandering and the correctness of the responses to the 1-back task. Mind wandering increased constantly during the simulated flight. At the end of the experiment, participants indicated that approx. 30% of their attention drifted away from the task.\u00a0\n\n\nThe results indicate that mind wandering indeed plays an important role for pilots when executing tasks that require continuous information processing, memory retention and manual input. These findings also imply that mind wandering will likely play an even bigger role with increasing levels of automation as the role of the pilots change from actors to mostly passive observers who monitor and supervise the systems in the unlikely event of automation failures. In light of these considerations, mind wandering should be researched further.","Submitter first name":"Anneke","Submitter last name":"Hamann","Submitter (affiliation)":"Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.

In our pharmacological manipulation study, we investigated the effects of methylphenidate, a drug enhancing catecholaminergic levels, on event segmentation. Employing a double-blind, cross-over design, participants completed an event segmentation task under both methylphenidate and placebo conditions. The findings suggest that methylphenidate modulates event segmentation, with effects contingent upon prior experience: when initial experiences were under placebo, methylphenidate fine-tuned event segmentation. Conversely, when initial experiences occurred under methylphenidate, initial observations revealed heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli, which diminished upon subsequent task completion without methylphenidate. These findings underscore the complex interplay between catecholaminergic modulation and prior experience, reflecting a neurobiological manifestation of error detection and event schemata in event segmentation.","Submitter first name":"Astrid","Submitter last name":"Prochnow","Submitter (affiliation)":"Astrid Prochnow","Submitter (email)":"astrid.prochnow@ukdd.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"310":{"Id":160,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Using PCA for Analyzing Global Phase Synchronization of Neural Entrainment During Rhythmic Grasping Under Visuomotor Conflict","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"In this study, we employed principal component analysis (PCA) to project the entrained frequency phase time course from magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensor-level data into a high-dimensional subspace.

Secondly, we investigated the temporal dynamics of phase synchronization within this subspace: For each time point, we computed the average Euclidean distance between the data clouds representing the projected phase value of individual trial and their respective midpoint in the high-dimensional PCs space.\u00a0\n\n\nWe evaluated this method using MEG data recorded from eighteen participants performing a virtual reality-based, rhythmic hand-target phase matching task: Participants matched the phasic size change of a target dot (0.5 Hz) with the movements of a virtual hand (VH) that was controlled by their right hand via a data glove with a 0.5 s delay incongruently, and compared our results with those obtained through inter-trial coherence (ITC). Analyzing phase synchronization through PCA for phase time course projection yielded more informative outcomes both in spatial patterns and in time dynamics.

In a second step, weighting parameter w (representing the balance between model-based and model-free control) and self-reported impulsivity and compulsivity were entered into the model to examine how they modulate the relationship between signed RPE and EEG. The effect of RPE on FRN-related activity was mainly associated with higher w scores, and with impulsivity at trend-level. The interaction of impulsivity and w influenced both FRN- and P3a-related activity, pointing to an interplay of impulsivity with goal-directed control.

Importantly, impaired executive functions are associated with a reduced response to cognitive behavioral therapy in OCD. Many studies show that cognitive trainings can improve deficient cognitive functions. Therefore, a specific cognitive training was developed to address the diminished interference control and overactive action monitoring in OCD patients, aiming to offer a viable augmentation therapy option. The three-week training was conducted at home by OCD patients and involved a flanker and a n-back task. Task difficulty was dynamically adjusted based on individual performance, thus aiming to promote enhanced neurocognitive adaptability. In addition to behavioral measures, stimulus-locked and response-locked mediofrontal negativities (N2; correct-related negativity, CRN; error-related negativity, ERN) associated with cognitive control served as outcome measures. The adaptive training resulted in significant changes in the mediofrontal negativities of OCD patients: The N2 amplitude increased, while the CRN amplitude decreased in incompatible trials. Taken together, this pattern implies improved interference control and reduced action monitoring in OCD patients after training. Thus, the current study shows that deficient executive control in OCD can be improved with specifically tailored interventions thereby opening up clinical applications in preparation for or in addition to cognitive-behavioral therapy.","Submitter first name":"Maxi Alicia","Submitter last name":"Ganser","Submitter (affiliation)":"Medical School Berlin","Submitter (email)":"maxi.ganser@medicalschool-berlin.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"314":{"Id":164,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Individual Differences and (Epi)Genetics","Title":"Parental Behavior and DNA Methylation of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene \u2013 The Moderating Role of Personality","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Parental behavior, especially in childhood, affects the child\u2019s development in numerous ways.

Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is present in most individuals with SAD, but it is even more widespread in the general population. Exposure therapy is the central therapeutic component in the treatment of excessive anxiety. Augmentation of exposure therapy and developing novel exposure techniques are key to improving treatment. While a recent meta-analysis shows promising results regarding the efficacy of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), there is still a need for more economical and accessible digital interventions. We aim to validate a standardized protocol for digital exposure targeting PSA. In a first online study, participants deliver multiple speeches across several days in front of a prerecorded audience (undisclosed). Preliminary analyses indicate a significant reduction in PSA on a subjective level. In a second study we aim to adapt the protocol to the laboratory, and incorporate psychophysiological measures such as skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR). A follow-up will be added to investigate translational effects in a real environment (vs. digital). In addition, results from the second study on behavioral and physiological responses will be compared to an in vivo protocol. The results of these studies should allow to understand 1) if a digital exposure can be clinically valuable as an additional therapeutical tool, 2) how such a protocol can be applied to studies in the laboratory and be used for basic science research, 3) how effects of a digital intervention transfer to real life situations.","Submitter first name":"Steven","Submitter last name":"Klein","Submitter (affiliation)":"Steven Klein","Submitter (email)":"steven.klein1@uni-saarland.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"337":{"Id":189,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Reward morphs non-spatial cognitive maps in humans","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Animals and humans maintain a cognitive map of the environment using unique representations that might be influenced by introducing reward to it.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between loneliness and social distance discounting.\n\n\n\n\n\n165 participants completed a set of questionnaires and the Social Distance Discounting Task. During the task, participants selected options characterized by selfishness or generosity, resulting in either a substantial reward exclusively for them or smaller rewards shared between the participant and another individual at a specific social distance. Then, a hyperbolic social discount function was modeled, illustrating how rapidly the perceived value of money obtained by another person decreased with social distance through a hierarchical Bayesian model. The obtained discount rates and generosity scores were then correlated with levels of perceived social isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the association between general generosity and loneliness was not significant, higher discount rates were positively correlated with higher loneliness levels. Moreover, this association was fully mediated by social cognitive bias measures. Thus, while more lonely individuals might not be less altruistic in general, their propensity for altruistic behavior towards more socially distant people decreases significantly more than in less lonely individuals.

While threat information focused on common fearful apprehensions of bodily sensations as a sign of danger, safety information emphasized bodily sensations as indicative of good health and the functional adaption to environmental demands. Afterwards, all participants completed a differential fear conditioning procedure (acquisition and extinction), with temporary dyspnea induced by inspiratory resistive loads as US. Fear learning was assessed using subjective fear and US-expectancy ratings along with psychophysiological measures, i.e., skin conductance response (SCR) and startle eyeblink. Preliminary results (N= 39) suggest that participants in the safety group developed better CS+\/CS- differentiation during the first half of acquisition. This is indicated by a larger startle magnitude to CS+ compared to ITI and CS- and a smaller magnitude to CS- compared to ITI. None of these differences were observed in the threat group. Also, CS+\/ CS- differentiation in US-Expectancy developed faster and was more pronounced throughout acquisition in safety as compared to threat group.

Therefore, this article compares wayfinding and recognition performance for visual and olfactory landmarks learned by 52 participants in a virtual maze. Furthermore, it is one of the first empirical studies investigating differences in memory effects on human navigation by using two separate test situations one month apart. The experimental task was to find the way through a maze-like virtual environment with either olfactory or visual cues at the intersections that served as decision points.

In contrast, when using visual landmarks wayfinding performance decreased significantly, while visual landmarks overall lead to better recognition than olfactory landmarks at both times of testing. The results demonstrate the unique character of human odor memory and support the conclusion that olfactory cues may be used in human spatial orientation. Furthermore, the present study expands the research field of human wayfinding by providing a study that investigates memory for landmark knowledge and route decisions for the visual and olfactory modality.

Recent work suggests a crucial role for moment-to-moment neural variability in cognitive flexibility. In particular, a boost in variability (expressed as entropy) in medial prefrontal regions during a visual decision-making task reliably predicts an individual\u2019s ability to keep performing well under more pressing conditions ([Kloosterman et al., 2020][1]). Here, we tested whether auditory decisions show a similar neural signature using data from [W\u00f6stmann et al. (2019)][2]. \n**Methods:** In a behavioural and electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, 32 young adults (22 female) performed an auditory discrimination task in which they decided whether a to-be-attended two-tone sequence ascended or descended in pitch. A distractor sequence was played simultaneously from another location with either the same (congruent) or opposite pitch direction (incongruent). Overall task performance was kept ~70% correct using a staircase procedure. We quantified neural variability using time-resolved, multi-scale entropy (description [here][3]). \n**Results:** Behavioural accuracy declined in incongruent vs. congruent trials, indicating increased difficulty. Crucially, participants with stronger incongruent\u2013congruent entropy in midfrontal electrodes during the first tone showed a smaller corresponding drop in accuracy. This suggests that increased entropy reduces distractor interference and benefits task performance. Controlling for 4-8 Hz (theta) power modulation \u2013 typically associated with cognitive control \u2013 did not affect this relationship. \n**Conclusion:** Modulation of brain signal variability depending on task difficulty might reflect the flexible allocation of cognitive resources to protect task performance. \n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/articles\/54201\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/39\/49\/9797.abstract\n  [3]: https:\/\/www.fieldtriptoolbox.org\/example\/entropy_analysis\/","Submitter first name":"Niels","Submitter last name":"Kloosterman","Submitter (affiliation)":"Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck","Submitter (email)":"n.kloosterman@uni-luebeck.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"354":{"Id":206,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Development and Aging ","Title":"Associations of Infant Colic with Sleeping Problems from Childhood through Adolescence","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Colic is characterized by high levels of unsoothable crying for more than three hours daily, peaking around six weeks postpartum.

We tested 20 participants and observed that both EEB and EAB were significantly lower in the block-FEEB compared to the original FEEB.

Social touch can provide comfort and facilitate the maintenance of social bonds, and preliminary evidence indicates a negative evaluation of social touch in patients with BPD. Skin-mediated signals have been conceptualized as a form of interoception and BPD has been associated with altered sensation and interpretation of inner bodily signals. However, the neural mechanisms underlying aberrant touch and interoceptive attention processing in BPD and their role for social impairments are still unclear. We recruited 55 BPD patients and 31 Healthy Controls (HC) and used functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging to probe neural responses to slow (i.e. C-tactile (CT)-optimal) and fast (i.e. CT-suboptimal) touch before and after four weeks of inpatient Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Additionally, BPD patients underwent an fMRI paradigm to evaluate their interoceptive attention by focusing on either their heart or stomach. Results revealed a negative bias towards social touch in BPD patients before the DBT, evident in a significantly more negative attitude towards and reduced comfort zones of social touch. Despite significant improvements in overall BPD symptom load, dysfunctional social touch processing persisted after four weeks of DBT. Neural findings suggest that impairments in the insula-mediated integration of sensory and affective components of CT-optimal touch may constitute a biological signature of interpersonal problems in BPD.

We examined whether genetically-predicted estradiol levels (i.e., exposure variable), are causally linked to depression, AD, and BAG (i.e., separate outcome variables) in females, by conducting two-sample MR analyses using female-specific summary statistics from previously conducted and newly run genome-wide association studies (Ndstradiol = 163,985; Ndepression = 41,937; NAD = 12,772; NBAG = 14,287).

Failure-motivated individuals prefer easy and very difficult tasks, while success-motivated people prefer moderately difficult tasks. This difference is partly explained by variations in error processing. However, the relation of achievement motivation and neural indicators of error processing has not yet been investigated. In this exploratory EEG study, participants (n=99) performed a response selection task with two difficulty levels. We investigated the relationships between both motivation types and performance, error detection and error processing (reflected by error\/correct positivity \u2013Pe\/c and error\/correct negativity \u2013Ne\/c). Highly failure-motivated individuals showed lower performance, especially in the more difficult task, and a reduced Pe\/c difference. Only for these individuals the error-evidence accumulation resembled the one of correct responses. A high level of either motivation type was related to high error sensitivity, and high\/low levels of both orientations were related to low sensitivity. Success- and failure-motivated individuals are sensitive to errors, but presumably for different reasons. It is suggested that errors may be relevant to success-motivated individuals because of their inherent learning-potential and to failure-motivated individuals because of the threat to self-esteem. Furthermore, failure-motivated individuals seem to achieve high sensitivity by evaluating their responses very cautiously, like others only do in difficult tasks. They may prefer easy tasks because of the smaller number of committed errors while error processing does not seem to differ, resulting in an overall lower threat to self-esteem.","Submitter first name":"Yannik","Submitter last name":"Wilk","Submitter (affiliation)":"Yannik Wilk","Submitter (email)":"yannik.wilk@uni-koeln.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"360":{"Id":212,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Learning, Memory, and Sleep","Title":"Studying Schema Memory Formation in Rodents","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Schema memories, representing patterns of general knowledge acquired from multiple experiences, play a crucial role in organizing perception and facilitating learning of new information.

Participants can choose to accept a twofold offer with independent probabilities for monetary rewards and painful stimulations, or to reject the offer, being safe from pain but also losing the chance of obtaining money. Importantly, they face these decisions either alone or in presence of another individual. Using ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigate the neural activity during the presentation of the conflict decisions (probabilities for money vs pain) and compare the respective effects between the alone and the social condition.

We hypothesised that increased synchronisation of brain oscillations, i.e., inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC), in the delta range (0.5-3Hz) enhances temporal prediction accuracy.\n\nSource level analysis revealed significantly stronger delta ITPC during the time prediction task versus the luminance matching task, particularly in the time frame between the visuo-tactile stimulus' disappearance and the visual stimulus' reappearance in clusters of the right inferotemporal as well as left and right primary visual cortex (cluster-p=0.02). This supports the notion that stimulation in one sensory modality can reset the phase of ongoing low-frequency oscillations in other modalities. Furthermore, increased delta ITPC correlated with the accuracy of participants' timing predictions in the temporal prediction condition only (r=0.7, p=0.001). \n\nOur findings suggest that the increase in delta ITPC is likely due to a phase reset that supports the temporal prediction process, a mechanism that could be universal across different kind of stimuli and sensory modalities. This neural basis for temporal prediction underscores the complex interplay between sensory integration and time perception, providing insights into how our brains construct a coherent sense of event timings from diverse sensory inputs.","Submitter first name":"Rebecca","Submitter last name":"Burke","Submitter (affiliation)":"Rebecca Burke","Submitter (email)":"rebecca.burke@studium.uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"367":{"Id":220,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Brain and Periphery, Neuroendocrinology, and Stress","Title":"Stress-induced movement inhibition during acute psychosocial stress predicts HPA axis response","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"The experience of social-evaluative threat leads to strong physiological and behavioral responses.

This project seeks to augment the efficacy of conventional cessation strategies by leveraging underlying mechanisms of supplementary interventions to enhance cognitive control. Sleep, intricately linked with memory consolidation and cognitive function, is involved in both smoking and cessation efforts. Furthermore, sleep directly influences cognitive control and can indirectly enhance skills acquired during wakefulness via consolidation. Our previous research revealed promising evidence indicating that bolstering cognitive control positively correlates with treatment success, demonstrated through chess-based cognitive remediation training (CB-CRT). The presented project will employ sleep EEG measurements to investigate how sleep enhances cognitive control both directly and indirectly through sleep-dependent consolidation of CB-CRT training. We will optimize sleep quality by asking participants to perform a standardized HIIT, monitored using Actigraphy and heart rate feedback, which has been shown to especially benefit NonREM-sleep. Additionally, neural correlates of cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex will be measured using fMRI. By integrating two complementary interventions, CB-CRT and HIIT, this project aims to elevate abstinence rates and uncover the mechanisms underlying these interventions. Addressing sleep disturbances prevalent in individuals with TUD (n=132), we hypothesize that optimizing sleep quality will enhance cognitive function directly and amplify CB-CRT's cognitive benefits, thus promoting sustained smoking cessation.","Submitter first name":"Michaela","Submitter last name":"Kroth","Submitter (affiliation)":"Department of Clinical Psychology, Central Institute of Mental Health, University of Heidelberg","Submitter (email)":"michaela.kroth@zi-mannheim.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"371":{"Id":224,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Affective Neuroscience","Title":"Communicative social intentions modulate emotional mimicry responses","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"The coordinated exchange of facial expressions is an important part of face-to-face social interactions.

While past research explored the influence of pain on decision-making and the effect of reward on pain, the impact of motivation on pain perception remains insufficiently examined. Our study introduces a novel task to systematically probe how motivation and decisions to endure pain affect pain experiences. We recruited 22 participants (12 female). Each trial began with a monetary offer (low, medium, or high), followed by a painful heat stimulus of moderate or high intensity. Participants then decided to accept or decline the offer. Afterward, they received a second painful stimulus. If they accepted the offer, stimulus intensity remained the same, and in half of the trials, a grip force task had to be performed successfully in order to obtain the reward offered. Rejecting the offer reduced the intensity of the second stimulus (high to moderate, moderate to low) but demanded no grip force exertion and produced no reward. Results revealed that participants felt less pain after they accepted an offer compared to after they declined an offer of the same value. For heat stimuli of moderate intensity, the pain reduction from deciding to act was dependent on the offer value, as only medium and high, but not low offers significantly reduced pain between the first and the second stimulus.

Errors lead to a burst in theta and delta power in EEG oscillations. In particular, Theta has been proposed to represent a mechanism to communicate the need for cognitive control across prefrontal brain regions. Error processing and theta as well as delta power have been repeatedly shown to be increased in patients with OCD. In addition, OCD patients show reduced flexible adjustments in error-monitoring under speed and accuracy instructions. However, it remains unclear to what extent these changes are associated with altered theta and delta dynamics. Therefore, the aim of this project is to re-analyze EEG data collected in a previous study (Riesel et al., 2019, *Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 128 (7)*) on error-monitoring and instruction dependent adaptions in OCD patients. Data from 28 healthy participants and 28 patients with OCD was analyzed applying a time-frequency analysis as well as a coupling analysis using magnitude-squared coherence. Results indicate an overall increase in theta and delta power as well as a tendency towards less theta power differences between speed and accuracy conditions in OCD patients compared to healthy controls following errors. Coherency results give reason to assume that for OCD patients in prefrontal cortex frequency coupling is increased and less flexible. All this provides support for the hypothesis that cognitive control is altered and flexibility of performance-monitoring is reduced in OCD patients. \n\n**Funding**: DFG-Grant RI2853\/2-2","Submitter first name":"Alexander","Submitter last name":"Dolge","Submitter (affiliation)":"Alexander Dolge","Submitter (email)":"alexander.dolge@uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"374":{"Id":227,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Learning, Memory, and Sleep","Title":"Increasing eyewitness identification accuracy in lineups using 3D interactive virtual reality (3DIL)","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"**Background**\nAccurate witness identification (ID) is a cornerstone of police inquiries and national security investigations.

Limitations in prior research are a lack of consistent separation between BED and obesity, and a disregard for self-report evidence suggesting that neurocognitive alterations may emerge primarily in loss-\/harm-avoidance contexts. Addressing these gaps, this longitudinal study investigated behavioral flexibility and its underlying neuro-computational processes in reward-seeking and loss-avoidance contexts. Obese participants with BED (BED), without BED (OB), and healthy normal-weight participants (NW) (N=96) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task during fMRI, with different blocks focused on obtaining wins and avoiding losses, respectively. They were reinvited for a 6-months follow-up. Unlike BED, OB performed worse in the win than the loss condition. Analyses informed by computational reinforcement learning (RL) models showed that this was explained by differential learning sensitivities in the win vs. loss conditions between groups. This was echoed in differential neural learning signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) per condition. The differences were subtle but scaled with BED symptoms, such that more severe BED symptoms were associated with increasing bias towards improved learning from wins vs losses. Independent from motivational contexts, OB switched more between choice options than NW. This was reflected in diminished representation of choice certainty in the vmPFC. Our study shows that RL alterations in obesity with and without BED may be qualitatively different and highlights the importance of distinguishing between them to identify unique neuro-computational alterations underlying different styles of maladaptive eating behavior.","Submitter first name":"Maria","Submitter last name":"Waltmann","Submitter (affiliation)":"Maria Waltmann","Submitter (email)":"waltmann_m@ukw.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"376":{"Id":229,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Is rest simply the best?

Two unsolved questions are whether EMREO depends on the retinal input and whether EMREO adapts to sensory experience. To answer these questions, two experiments were conducted in healthy adult individuals. In Experiment 1 (n = 21), participants performed free eye movements in a darkened room without any visual or auditory stimulation to test whether the EMREO depends on the presence of visual saccade targets. In Experiment 2 (n = 24) EMREOs were measured before and after exposure to audio-visual stimuli with a consistent SOA of either 0 ms or 230 ms visual-leading to test the influence of crossmodal temporal recalibration on EMREO. In both experiments an eye tracker and in-ear microphones were used to record eye movements and eardrum oscillations. The saccadic and eardrum data were aligned with respect to the saccade onset. In Experiment 1, regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between the eardrum oscillations and horizontal eye movements, suggesting an independence of EMREO from current visual and auditory input. In Experiment 2, group-averaged EMREOs were not affected by adaptation to either of the SOAs. However, adaptation with 0 ms SOA reduced the between-subject variation in the EMREO amplitude compared to baseline, while adaptation with 230 ms SOA increased the between-subject variation in the EMREO amplitude. In summary, our data suggest that EMREOs depend on oculomotor signals rather than on current sensory input, but might be susceptible to recent sensory experience.","Submitter first name":"Hossein","Submitter last name":"Abbasi","Submitter (affiliation)":"Biological Psychology and Neuropsychology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany","Submitter (email)":"hossein.abbasi@uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"379":{"Id":232,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Adaptive Integration of Perceptual and Reward Information in an Uncertain World","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"To learn and make decisions, we need to combine perceptual information about stimuli and states of the environment with reward information about choice options.

We specifically calculated task-based global graph measures for the functional networks that were activated during expected trials, trials requiring a flexible updating of predictions, and trials that required the stabilization of predictions. By implementing multivariate Bayesian generalized linear models, we found functional network alterations during all event types, which indicated less centralized, less integrated, and simultaneously less segregated network topology in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. In addition, the rate of correctly detected switches, requiring flexible updating of internal models, predicted global graph measures differently for patients compared to controls. In particular, lower cognitive flexibility in patients was associated with stronger deficits regarding the integration of functional networks. Overall, the results suggest that the functional network topology in schizophrenia is less optimally organized compared to the neurotypical brain, which results in less flexible and stable cognitive processing.","Submitter first name":"Anoushiravan","Submitter last name":"Zahedi","Submitter (affiliation)":"University of Muenster","Submitter (email)":"azahedi@uni-muenster.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"382":{"Id":236,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"Representation of a continuous decision variable in human extrastriate visual cortex","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"People often infer the state of the environment by accumulating evidence over time.

Yet, the mechanism of action remains unclear, and the effects on neuromodulatory systems are poorly understood, largely due to differences in stimulation parameters across studies. Recently, it was proposed that vagal stimulation leads to changes in putative physiological markers of noradrenergic activity including pupil dilation, salivary alpha amylase, P300, and alpha oscillations. In this pre-registered study, we compare pupil dilation under phasic (1s) and tonic (30s) taVNS, in a task-free, single-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Pupil dilation significantly and rapidly increased under active phasic taVNS stimulation compared to sham, and rapidly declined after stimulation offset. Surprisingly, tonic taVNS induced a similarly rapid (and larger than sham) increase in pupil size, returning to baseline within 5 s, despite ongoing stimulation. As such, we show that both active and sham tonic modes closely resembled the phasic effect, without any sustained effects of stimulation on tonic pupil size. This result suggests that brief taVNS pulses under standard parameters may be better suited for noradrenergic manipulation in behavioural tasks than longer stimulation trains, and sheds light on the temporal profiles of brief and long stimulation patterns, with implications for their applicability in further research.","Submitter first name":"Lina","Submitter last name":"Skora","Submitter (affiliation)":"Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf","Submitter (email)":"l.skora@hhu.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"385":{"Id":239,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Development and Aging","Title":"How do childhood negative life events and brain development relate to depression in young adulthood?","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Background: Early negative life events (NLE) have long\u2010lasting influences on neurodevelopment and psychopathology.

Using a complete longitudinal design with four time points, we examined whether NLE during childhood and early adolescence predict depressive symptoms in young adulthood through accelerated OFC thinning across adolescence. \nMethods: We acquired structural MRI from 321 participants at two sites across four time points from ages 14 to 22.

These adaptative processes (e.g., measured as post-error slowing or accuracy, PES and PEA, respectively) are triggered by the performance monitoring system, represented by the error-related negativity (ERN) in the event-related potential. The ERN, originating in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), reflects automatic error processing, while the required behavioural adaptation is assumed to be implemented by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Yet, it is unknown whether the functioning of the ACC is independent of subsequent processes associated with the DLPFC. \nHere, we probe the functional relationship between the ACC and DLPFC by (i) disrupting activity within the right DLPFC through triple-pulse TMS shortly after errors, and (ii) observing changes in ERN peak amplitude after DLPFC stimulation compared to a control stimulation condition (primary motor cortex). To this end, we applied simultaneous TMS-EEG, while participants engaged in a demanding cognitive control task (i.e., the speeded-inference game). \nData from 38 participants revealed that interfering with right DLPFC activity immediately after error commission did not alter PES, PEA nor the ERN amplitude. This could indicate that the online stimulation was not effective. However, we observed distinct stimulation-induced changes in the functional associations between neurophysiological data and behavioural measures. Thus, in contrast to immediate effects, we can show that disruption of the DLPFC around error commission rather triggered adaptive, dynamic changes in error processing throughout the course of the experiment supporting the hypothesized interdependence between DLPFC and ACC.","Submitter first name":"Eva","Submitter last name":"Nie\u00dfen","Submitter (affiliation)":"Eva Nie\u00dfen","Submitter (email)":"e.niessen@uni-koeln.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"387":{"Id":241,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Well, would you look at the time - Comparing of the influence of different cortical organizational schemes on the temporal layout of the cortex","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Different brain areas express different intrinsic timescales that are crucial for processing stimuli on various levels of temporal persistency.

This study investigates the RC's role in shaping the timescales in direct comparison to other organizational schemes and gradients. We collected resting-state-fMRI-, task-fMRI- and diffusion-weighted-imaging-data of 47 healthy, right-handed participants. The intrinsic resting-state-timescales of 219 cortical areas were determined using a model-free calculation of the autocorrelation decay. We compared four different organizational schemes: (1) the structural RC, (2) the gradient from unimodal to multimodal cortices, (3) the posterior-lateral-to-anterior-medial gradient, (4) and the diverse club as an alternative to the RC. Exploratively, we also included measures of graph centrality and cortical thickness. While the expected effects were identified for all schemes of interest, Bayesian model comparison revealed the unimodal-to-multimodal and posterior-lateral-to-anterior-medial gradients to be best fitting. Additionally, using hierarchically structured stimuli we identified temporal receptive windows (TRW) across the cortex. Model comparison demonstrated that the posterior-lateral-to-anterior-medial gradient best explained the distribution of TRW. Moreover, the effects of this gradient as well as the unimodal-to-multimodal gradient were especially pronounced in conditions targeting longer TRW. In conclusion, while the RC architecture has an influence on the intrinsic cortical timescales, our results demonstrate that the more suiting organizational schemes for the temporal layout at rest and in a task extend along posterior-lateral-to-anterior-medial or unimodal-to-multimodal gradients.","Submitter first name":"Falko","Submitter last name":"Mecklenbrauck","Submitter (affiliation)":"Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster","Submitter (email)":"f_meck01@uni-muenster.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"388":{"Id":242,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"The cerebellum is involved in processing reward prediction errors - evidence from patients with cerebellar stroke","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Predicting the consequences of our actions and processing discrepancies between predicted and actual outcomes is an essential function for surviving and thriving in our ever-changing environment.

Participants recruited along the impulsivity spectrum (n = 252) performed go\/nogo (GNGT; action suppression) and stop signal (SST; action cancellation) tasks, and a flanker paradigm with performance feedback (feedback valence) during electroencephalography (EEG). We established EEG task effects (nogo>go, successful stop>go, loss>gain) using single-trial regressions. Importantly, we examined how neural correlates of feedback processing and inhibition were associated as a function of NU. We assessed this moderation by testing interactions between NU and the feedback valence effect in predicting neural activity related to inhibition. Generally, higher feedback sensitivity (P3b) was associated with higher brain activity (P3) in both the GNGT and SST. In the SST only, this relationship was moderated by NU. High NU individuals who differentiated more between gains and losses also showed higher stopping-related activity. This relationship was less strongly pronounced in low NU. These results suggest that a link between outcome evaluation and action cancellation intensifies with increasing NU. Self-control may be challenging to high NU individuals with strong emotional responses (high sensitivity to valence) as they require considerable neural engagement during stopping.

In this study, we used a continuous pursuit-tracking paradigm consisting of randomly generated and repeated segments within each trial.

To probe the neural correlates underlying this age-related modulation, we examined theta band activity during the repeated and random segments. Our findings indicate elevated theta band activity in the medial frontal lobe during the random segment in adolescents, whereas adults exhibited heightened theta band activity in frontal regions during the repeated segment and decreased activity in areas of the ventral path during the same segment and outline a complex interplay of involved structures.

Crucially, whether monitoring of errors as indicated by external performance feedback is altered in OCD and differs between feedback for self-performed and observed actions is less clear. The present study compared OCD patients (n=29) with healthy controls (HC; n=31) and patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD; n=31) by using an active and observational variant of a probabilistic feedback learning task while EEG was recorded. As expected, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was increased for losses relative to wins, with larger win-loss differentiation for active compared to observational learning. Interestingly, OCD patients showed overall reduced FRN amplitudes, particularly following wins, but increased win-loss differentiation for active learning only. The feedback P3 was larger for losses versus wins for active but not observational learning in OCD compared with HCs. Importantly, P3 amplitudes were generally enhanced in OCD, independent of feedback valence. Comparing OCD with SAD patients, no differences emerged for FRN or feedback P3. The present results suggest aberrant feedback monitoring in OCD for own and observed outcomes, particularly affecting the processing of positive feedback during active learning. Given that no differences were found between OCD and SAD, altered feedback monitoring may underly shared symptoms including need for reassurance or perfectionism.

Athletes\u2019 position error is lower than non-athletes\u2019 when there is no feedback about their cursor movements, but direction error is not. We found no quantitative power differences in the investigated frequency bands, but evidence that athletes and non-athletes accomplish action emulation through different functional neuroanatomical structures, especially when alpha and beta band activity is concerned. Non-athletes seemed to rely on top-down inhibitory control to predict guesses on cursor trajectories in the absence of cursor position feedback. In contrast, athletes benefit from enhanced inhibitory gating mechanisms in the ventral stream and the integration of sensory and motor processes in the insular cortex, which apparently provides them with processing advantages in computing forward models. This advantage might be supported by alpha band activity in athletes' motor cortex, suggesting less inhibitory gating and a higher likelihood of executing integrated sensorimotor programs.

Subtle changes in social behaviors, including social withdrawal, can already be observed in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia (at-risk mental state) and play a crucial role in the chronic course of the disease. Patients increasingly lose contact with their social environment and are deprived of the health-promoting effects of interpersonal relationships, including romantic relationships and interpersonal touch. While previous studies have demonstrated abnormal brain structure and functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia, little is known about disease-related changes in domain-specific functional brain activity patterns such as interpersonal touch. The present study therefore aimed to investigate differences in the neural and behavioral correlates of social touch between patients with schizophrenia and a healthy control group without a family history of psychotic illness. Both groups underwent task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of social and nonsocial touch. To further characterize potential biases related to social touch, additional physical touch \"permission maps\" were measured. Psychometric questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to assess symptom burden and levels of psychosocial functioning. The present study may inform future strategies of using disease-associated neural and behavioral patterns of social touch as potential biomarkers of psychosocial deficits in order to improve prediction of disease progression, thus contributing to personalized therapeutic approaches for schizophrenia.","Submitter first name":"Danilo","Submitter last name":"Postin","Submitter (affiliation)":"Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Oldenburg","Submitter (email)":"danilo.postin1@uni-oldenburg.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"412":{"Id":269,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"The influence of cardiorespiratory phase locking on voluntary action initiation and sense of agency: preliminary results","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Sense of agency (SoA), the experience of controlling one\u2019s own actions and their effects, is thought to arise from the successful integration of predicted and actual sensory outcomes of intentional action, encompassing information about the body and the environment.

We imposed the limitation that in each run of the experiment, each intensity had to be chosen five times.

Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) in electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as a potential biomarker for these two motivational systems. Specifically, higher left-frontal EEG-activity is associated with approach tendencies, whereas lower levels suggest a propensity for withdrawal. Prior investigations into the relationship between social power and FAA have only utilized between-subject designs, limiting interpretations. In the current study, we employed a novel within-subject experimental paradigm to investigate the association between social power induction and FAA. Twenty-five participants underwent an established episodic recall task designed to induce states of high or low social power and a control condition, presented in random order. EEG alpha power (8-12 Hz) during these tasks was extracted to calculate FAA indices for frontal and parietal regions of both hemispheres. Our findings revealed a significant increase in left-hemispheric activity, which was not specific to frontal regions, during high social power induction compared to both low social power induction and the control condition. Notably, these latter two conditions also demonstrated significant differences. These results challenge previous assumptions regarding the specific frontal locus of alpha asymmetry and suggest a broader lateralization pattern across the brain in social power processing. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the neural underpinnings of social power dynamics and highlights the importance of within-subject designs in elucidating nuanced relationships between social power and neural activity.","Submitter first name":"Sebastian","Submitter last name":"Scholz","Submitter (affiliation)":"Sebastian Scholz","Submitter (email)":"sebastian.scholz@uni-bielefeld.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"416":{"Id":273,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Brain and Periphery, Neuroendocrinology, and Stress","Title":"Investigation into the relationship between long-term cortisol output and acute stress reactivity","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Stress and individual differences in stress reactivity are assumed to play a pivotal role in the onset and maintenance of various psychiatric disorders.

This includes difficulties in perceptual category learning, i.e. categorizing stimuli based on their holistic visual appearance.

Possible underlying mechanisms may be general difficulties in neural processes of visual learning, or a specific deficit in the abstraction of a category\u2019s central tendency; the so-called \"prototype\". However, the research is inconsistent and the exact mechanisms behind category learning deficits remain unclear.\n**Methods:** We investigated visual category acquisition in autistic individuals compared to neurotypical controls using an A\/hidden-B paradigm with abstract patterns. Bayesian computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to gain additional insights into the underlying mechanisms.\n**Preliminary results:** When categorising non-members, neurotypical controls (n = 74) outperformed autistic individuals (n = 36). Both model-based behavioural and fMRI analyses suggest that the autistic group relies more on a memory-based categorization strategy than the neurotypical group, posing an alternative to the prototype strategy. However, the data did not suggest any difficulties in prototype abstraction. Further analyses will be conducted to investigate potential confounds due to group differences.\n**Preliminary conclusions:** Our research supports earlier observations of category learning difficulties in autism. In line with the weak central coherence theory of autism, which proposes an autism-specific cognitive style rather than a deficit, our data speak towards an increased tendency towards using a memory-based strategy, in the absence of a prototype abstraction deficit.","Submitter first name":"Claire","Submitter last name":"Warren","Submitter (affiliation)":"(Universit Clinic Eppendorf","Submitter (email)":"claire.warren@charlotte-fresenius-uni.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"420":{"Id":277,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Prediction of individual cognitive test performance based on imaging and non-imaging data in older adults","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Early detection of cognitive decline gains relevance in normal aging given its impact on the qual-ity of life of older adults.

Whether such a tagging mechanism underlies selective stress effects on memory and, if so, how the proposed tag is set is unknown. However, it is assumed that the deviation of an event from expectation, resulting in a prediction error (PE), has a critical impact on memory formation. We therefore hypothesized that stress effects on the subsequent memory of surrounding neutral events may be related to the level of PE associated with these events. To test this hypothesis, participants completed two image encoding tasks separated by a psychosocial stressor or control manipulation. Overall, images associated with a higher PE were more likely to be remembered on the next day. Crucially, if a stressful encounter took place shortly before or after image encoding, the images associated with a high PE were even more likely to be remembered when compared to a non-stressful encounter.

Compared to controls, patients had lower HR during fear than other words. No associations with HRV were found. \n**Conclusion:** Our preliminary findings show emotional interference and emotional facilitation effects in patients with mental disorders. Results from electrocardiography suggest that resting HR and task-related HR, rather than HRV, are associated with emotional interference.","Submitter first name":"Sarah","Submitter last name":"Tholl","Submitter (affiliation)":"University of Konstanz","Submitter (email)":"sarah.tholl@uni-konstanz.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"431":{"Id":288,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Attention and Preception","Title":"The Effect of Action on the Shape of Audio-Visual Binding Window","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Previous research has demonstrated that the perceived onset time of a unisensory event, such as a brief sound, is altered when it is preceded or followed by the observer's motor action, with alterations inversely linked to sensory reliability. However, real-world scenarios often involve multisensory events preceded or followed by our actions. This study investigates how one's own motor actions influence audio-visual (AV) temporal binding using a binary simultaneity judgment (SJ2) task. The first experiment examines AV binding window modulations when stimuli are presented following the observer's actions (keypress actions) compared to passive presentation. Conversely, the second experiment explores modulations in the AV binding window when stimuli are preceded by observer's actions versus passive presentation. The temporal delay between action and AV pair (0, 500, and 1000ms) is manipulated, with temporal proximity considered a causal prior determining action influence on AV temporal binding. If actions alter perceived onset times of auditory and visual stimuli differently, particularly with auditory onset judgments being more reliable, AV temporal binding is expected to be affected. Results reveal altered AV binding, particularly with vision-leading trials, when stimuli are followed by the action with close temporal proximity (0ms) but not when preceded by the action. These findings imply that motor actions can selectively alter the perceived onset times of auditory and visual stimuli when they follow and are contiguous with the action, resulting in changes in AV temporal binding window widths.","Submitter first name":"Kishore Kumar","Submitter last name":"Jagini","Submitter (affiliation)":"University of Hamburg","Submitter (email)":"kishore.jagini@uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"432":{"Id":289,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Performance and exploration strategies in recurrent neural networks during reinforcement learning depend on network capacity.","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"**Introduction**: Artificial neural networks constitute simplified computational models of neural circuits that might help understand how the biological brain solves and represents complex tasks (Kriegeskorte, 2015).

To investigate the specific and general neurophysiological properties, we designed a task set that allowed us to disentangle and investigate the nature of binding and specific updating processes, namely substitution and transformation.\nWe recruited a heterogeneous sample of 151 participants (female = 89, mean age = 34.77, SD = 12.78) who completed a binding and two updating tasks while an EEG was recorded.

When comparing transformation and substitution, we also found an increase in positivity, especially within the traditional P3 time window. Our results point to notable differences in the neurophysiological processes underlying the different WM tasks, while indicating greater similarities for the different updating demands.

The complex interaction between genes and the environment not only complicates the identification of specific risk factors but also hinders researchers from pointing an etiological direction.

Here, one of the different study arms of the OCDTWIN projects and its results will be presented. \n\nMethods: We analysed the seed-based functional connectivity of resting-state functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging data of 14 MZ twins discordant for OCD and compared every affected twin with their unaffected sibling. The focus was on frontostriatal systems, using eight striatal seeds.  \n\nResults: Unaffected twins exhibit higher functional connectivity in multiple connections between substructures of the striatum, frontal as well as cortical areas. Differences could not be associated with any risk factor from the non-shared environment.  \n\nConclusion: Abnormalities in frontostriatal and general corticostriatal systems have been once again associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

This is because we tend to discount the subjective value of a reward the longer we have to wait for it. Critically, this so-called delay discounting can be reduced by episodic future thinking (EFT): After vividly imagining the future, we make more farsighted decisions. This well-documented effect is supported by hippocampal -prefrontal interactions. It is unclear, however, whether EFT induces a mental shift towards the future in general, or towards one specific time-point. In typical paradigms, participants simulate a future scenario (example: \u201cpub visit in 91 days\u201d) before choosing between two rewards offered at different delays (example: \u201c20\u20ac now or 30\u20ac in 91 days\u201d). Because the simulation delay and the later choice delay are typically matched, temporally unspecific and specific effects of EFT are conflated. In two behavioral experiments (n=84 total), we systematically varied concordance between the simulated delay and the choice delay. When the simulated delay matched the later choice delay, we replicated the beneficial effect of EFT on farsighted decisions. Critically, when the simulated delay instead matched the sooner of two delayed choices, the effect was reversed: Participants became more impulsive. In contrast, when the simulated delay was longer than the later choice delay, the beneficial effect was numerically reduced, but not abolished or reversed. Moreover, EFT vividness predicted farsighted choices when long but not short delays were simulated. We conclude that EFT exerts its effect via both temporally specific and unspecific mechanisms.","Submitter first name":"Heidrun","Submitter last name":"Schultz","Submitter (affiliation)":"Heidrun Schultz","Submitter (email)":"heidrun.schultz@tu-dresden.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"441":{"Id":298,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Learning, Memory, and Sleep","Title":"How to design a good localiser? \u2013 Capturing neural representations with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"As our brain adapts our behaviour based on our experiences, it needs to abstract from our complex environment.

In this study, we took a network neuroscience perspective on response monitoring to investigate functional brain network dynamics underlying conventional indicators of response monitoring. Participants (N = 90) performed a complex response selection task and provided metacognitive assessments of their response accuracy.

First, sight recovery participants (average duration of blindness = 12 years) and age-matched, normally sighted controls underwent MRS scanning at rest with their eyes opened and eyes closed, to obtain visual cortex Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA+) concentration, Glutamate\/Glutamine (Glx) concentration, and the concentration ratio of Glx\/GABA+, as measures of inhibition, excitation, and E\/I ratio respectively. Subsequently, EEG was recorded to assess aperiodic activity (1-20 Hz) as a neurophysiological measure of the cortical E\/I ratio, during rest with eyes open and eyes closed, and during flickering stimulation. Across all tested conditions, sight recovery individuals demonstrated a significantly lower visual cortex Glx\/GABA+ ratio compared to controls, and a higher intercept and steeper aperiodic slope at occipital electrodes. A lower Glx\/GABA+ ratio was associated with better visual acuity, and Glx concentration correlated positively with the aperiodic intercept in the conditions with visual input in sight recovery individuals. We interpret these findings as resulting from an increased excitability of the visual cortex as a consequence of congenital blindness, which might necessitate a commensurately decreased E\/I ratio following additional excitation from restored visual input.","Submitter first name":"Rashi ","Submitter last name":"Pant ","Submitter (affiliation)":"University of Hamburg","Submitter (email)":"rashi.sharuani.pant@uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"448":{"Id":305,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Beyond Expectation: A Novel Paradigm Disentangling Semantic Processing and Predictive Coding","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"In language research, a key question revolves around the interaction of semantic processing and prediction.

We implement a novel paradigm enhancing the traditional semantic priming experiment by using three consecutive words from the same category as primes (long condition, e.g., apple\/banana\/orange\/**pear [related] vs. elephant [unrelated]**) and comparing it with the classical priming effect (short condition, e.g., apple\/**pear [related] vs. elephant [unrelated]**). At the target word (50% related, 50% unrelated, each category consisting of an equal distribution of real and pseudowords), participants perform a lexical decision task, with their responses analysed separately for real and pseudowords using the Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) focusing on drift rate. We expect slower evidence accumulation in long unrelated condition due to Bayesian prediction reflected by negative drift rate in the DDM.\nOur preliminary results (n = 5) show that there was a significant positive effect of long condition for both real and pseudowords, meaning that participants were more assured in their decision compared to short condition. The influence of an unrelated target was significantly positive for real words: participants were more confident in their decision in comparison to a related target. Finally, for pseudowords, there was a significant negative interaction between an unrelated target and long condition, supporting our hypothesis on Bayesian prediction involvement in the semantic processing.\nWe intend to present a comprehensive analysis of the data from 20 participants at the upcoming conference.","Submitter first name":"Anna","Submitter last name":"Petukhova","Submitter (affiliation)":"Translational Neuroimaging Group, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg","Submitter (email)":"anna.petukhova@uni-marburg.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"449":{"Id":306,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Affective Neuroscience","Title":"Does task focus tune emotion processing in the brain?","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"It is part of life to experience emotionally significant events like car crashes, financial difficulties, a promotion, or a birthday party.

The current preregistered study (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17605\/OSF.IO\/DX9YT) investigated the effect of emotion and social content on following an attention shift task by combining eye-tracking and Electroencephalography. The study investigated how participants shift their attention away (i.e., disengage) from images varying in emotional (positive, negative, neutral) and social (social, nonsocial) content. Participants were instructed to shift their attention promptly from the central emotional target to the peripheral neutral one. Results showed that they took longer to disengage from central images with social than nonsocial content, p = .006, d = .455, but the emotional content did not affect saccade latency, p = .127. The Early Posterior Negativity significantly responded to emotional valence, p < .001, suggesting that emotional stimuli were processed before the appearance of the peripheral target. However, it seemed that this emotional activity was suppressed as the task continued. In conclusion, these findings suggest that social content has a notable influence on attention-demanding tasks, while even simple tasks can partially moderate the impact of emotion. This suppression mechanism may be instrumental in overcoming the effects of highly emotional experiences, particularly negative ones.","Submitter first name":"Sahura","Submitter last name":"Ertugrul","Submitter (affiliation)":"PhD Candidate","Submitter (email)":"sa_er@uni-bremen.de;sahura@uni-bremen.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"450":{"Id":307,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Open, Reproducible and Meta Science","Title":"A lab of all trades: What to consider when setting up a multi-method psychophysiology lab for developmental clinical research","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Psychophysiological research with children and adolescents is vital for understanding the development of psychological disorders.

In the current experiment, we investigated whether this effect can also be found after a longer retrieval interval. In a balanced 2x2 between-subject design, 60 healthy men either underwent a stressful or non-stressful control version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Both conditions were modified with central and peripheral objects. Additionally, committee members wore accessories on their bodies. Either one day or seven days later, recognition memory for the objects was tested. Negative affect, subjective stress and saliva cortisol concentrations increased in the stress, but not in the control group verifying a successful stress induction. As expected, memory performance for all objects deteriorated after seven days when compared to the results after one day. Contrary to our expectations, stressed participants better recognized peripheral, but not central objects compared to non-stressed participants one day after the TSST. We found no further between-group differences in memory performance regardless of the retrieval interval. In summary, our findings could not confirm enhanced memory for central visual elements of a stressful episode neither after one day nor after seven days.

Therefore, we examined whether acute stress would facilitate occipital-mediated ultra-short-term and, to a lesser degree, occipital and frontal-mediated short-term memory processes, impair hippocampal-mediated long-term memory processes, and minimally alter frontal-mediated working memory processes along with their respective performance measures.

Overall, our acute stress induction was successful and significantly impaired the Free-Recall performance (\u03c72 (1) = 5.70, p < .001).

The present pharmacological fMRI study investigates (1) whether and how the selective dopamine D2\/3 receptor agonist pramipexole modulates the connectivity of resting-state brain networks and (2) whether modulations as such can explain changes in individuals' impulsive behavior. Twenty-five healthy male volunteers completed resting-state fMRI after receiving a single oral dose of 0.5 mg pramipexole or placebo. Subsequently, they performed three monetary-choice tasks. During the tasks the participants took repeated choices between two available rewards: a smaller immediate (or more likely, or less effortful) reward and a larger delayed (or less likely, or more effortful) reward, respectively. The participants\u2019 behavior in each task was modelled by fitting a hyperbolic function to choice preferences. The decay rate at which future reward was discounted was used as a proxy of impulsivity. Pramipexole down-regulated the inter-connectivity between the insular\/anterior cingulate cortex and somatomotor network, but significantly increased the inter-connectivity of the precentral gyrus and somatomotor network. Importantly, lower connectivity between cinguloopercular and somatomotor network under pramipexole correlated with higher impulsivity during delay and probability discounting tasks, but less impulsivity in effort discounting task. Collectively, these results suggest that in healthy individuals pramipexole shifts the brain networks from an executive-control mode to a more action-control mode. This reconfiguration may reduce top-down control of temporal or probabilistic impulses, but support motor decisions during effortful actions.","Submitter first name":"Mohsen ","Submitter last name":" Alavash","Submitter (affiliation)":"Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie","Submitter (email)":"mohsen.alavash@uni-luebeck.de","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"462":{"Id":319,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"The functional form of context-dependence in perceptual multialternative decisions","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Decisions are rarely made in isolation; they are often influenced by the dynamics of the context, whether spatial or temporal. Several studies have demonstrated that the selection between two economic alternatives can be swayed by the introduction of a third, inferior alternative (referred to as a distractor), contradicting the principles of rational choice theory. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of a distractor enhances (i.e., positive distractor effect) or impedes (i.e., negative distractor effect) choice accuracy, or if it modulates reaction time with no discernible distractor effect. Theories based on normalization, such as divisive and range normalization, offer explanations for various forms of the distractor effect by proposing that the value of each alternative is normalized by a summary statistic of the values in a decision context. To further explore the consistency of these conflicting effects, we designed a novel task involving perceptual stimuli. By employing perceptual alternatives instead of economic values, we ensured that the value information of all alternatives would be simultaneously available, enabling us to thoroughly investigate the influence of spatial context on decision-making. Additionally, we aimed to ascertain whether the distractor effect is limited to value-based decisions or extends to a broader range of choices.

Recently, the interplay of theta band activity (TBA) and alpha band activity (ABA) was shown to be essential for successful response inhibition in neurotypical (NT) adults when simultaneously integrated perception-action representations needed to be modified. We therefore examined whether and how response inhibition deficits in AD(H)D are further enhanced or attenuated by different degrees of conflict. Additionally, we investigated how both the behavioral performance and the oscillatory activity of adolescents (11-17 years of age) with AD(H)D (n = 28) differ from NT controls (n = 33) regarding their performance on a well-established conflict Go\/Nogo paradigm. Overall, multiple lines of evidence (behavioral and neurophysiological) suggest that adolescents with AD(H)D seem to be more strongly affected than NT controls by increased response inhibition demands through additional conflicts. Further, findings of the current study indicate that behavioral deficits in AD(H)D likely develop via deficient top-down modulation of ABA that leads to a delayed ability to monitor cognitive processes and updating of mental representations of working memory content rather than from deficiencies in TBA modulation per se or due to differences in activated brain structures. These findings may help to inform more targeted interventions for affected individuals with AD(H)D.","Submitter first name":"Katharina","Submitter last name":"Graf","Submitter (affiliation)":"Katharina Graf","Submitter (email)":"katharina.graf1@tu-dresden.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"466":{"Id":323,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Development and Aging","Title":"The Impact of Smoking Initiation in Late Adolescence on Functional Network Organization in the Transition to Early Adulthood","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"The interconnected salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and central executive network (CEN) are known to be acutely affected by nicotine exposure.

We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 100 participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. We found some evidence that participants accrued more reward and achieved better generalisation to unseen bandits when the slow feature predicted reward, as compared to the fast feature. These effects were stronger when participants experienced the feature speed before learning about rewards. Modelling this behaviour with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants' performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning could favour slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.","Submitter first name":"Noa","Submitter last name":"Hedrich","Submitter (affiliation)":"University of Hamburg","Submitter (email)":"noa.hedrich@uni-hamburg.de","Gender":"female = 1, male = 0, diverse = 0, not specified = 0","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"469":{"Id":326,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"The Visual Perception of Figures in Textures: An EEG Source Localization Study","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Feature integration and its role in figure-texture segregation is a key issue in visual perception.

Texture patterns were better detected in Gabor random fields when defined by feature contrast in orientation and spatial frequency, but only when they were barely detectable by a single feature. Previous EEG findings showed a long-lasting negative potential starting at 130 milliseconds, specific to feature combination stimuli, at inferior-temporal (TP) electrodes, with currently no clear evidence for a synergy correlate at central occipital (OZ) electrodes. This suggests that feature integration occurs in later shape-processing areas. In this study, our aim was to detect the sources of feature synergy effects in texture perception using EEG data. In a sample of 45 individuals, we used a special experimental design to find electrophysiological differences between the feature contrasts: orientation, spatial frequency, and feature summation of both. Furthermore, we tested whether the effects are equal if participants only had to detect if there was a figure in the texture or if they had to discriminate between different orientations of the figures.

Unravelling the biochemical mechanisms of MI could contribute to the understanding of conditions related to MI, such as aphantasia (= absence of voluntary MI), but also open up possibilities for interventions to improve or restore MI. To test the influence of a pharmacological dopamine depletion on voluntary MI, *n* = 7 male participants received an amino acid mixture consisting of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and tryptophan (TRP) to transiently reduce dopamine synthesis. Another group of *n* = 8 male participants were given a placebo drink. Before and after ingestion of BCAA\/TRP or placebo mixture, MI was assessed via mental imagery priming. Results showed that MI strength was affected by dopamine depletion, as reflected by a significant decrease in the experimental group compared to controls.

A growing literature suggests that attention moves rhythmically between stimuli at around 4 \u2013 8 Hz. However, recent studies have proposed that attentional switching can also be accounted for by aperiodic temporal structure. Neural activity has been shown to exhibit distinct timescales, i.e. periods during which sensory information may affect the response, which are crucial for information integration and segregation. Sensory areas display shorter timescales that might enable rapid processing of environmental changes, whereas association areas have longer timescales that might support sustained cognitive processes. To date, little is known about how intrinsic timescales modulate attention and perception. In this study, we addressed this caveat in the literature by analyzing datasets combining different methods and attention modalities. We examined timescales on well-established attention tasks in combination with invasive electrocorticography (ECoG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG). Our results reveal that neural timescales dynamically vary across the task and regions and significantly decrease during spatial attention. Furthermore, in a visual search task, which requires sustained representation of task-relevant items, we observed longer timescales when information is retained longer. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for the idea that multiple, non-oscillatory timescales are simultaneously present across the cortex, that they flexibly adapt to cognitive demands and that both periodic and aperiodic temporal structures contribute to attention control.","Submitter first name":"Isabel","Submitter last name":"Raposo","Submitter (affiliation)":"Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research","Submitter (email)":"isabel.raposo@student.uni-tuebingen.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"472":{"Id":329,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Development and Aging","Title":"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback reduces hippocampal hyperactivity and improves pattern separation in Mild Cognitive Impairment","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Introduction: When examining pattern separation using task fMRI, several studies found hippocampal hyperactivity and worse task performance in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

In this preregistered study (n = 45), we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of sensory prediction, i.e. the attenuation of the N1 and P2 component of the auditory event-related potential, of sounds caused by self-performed, imagined, and observed motor actions, and of visually-cued external sounds compared to (uncued) external sounds, respectively. We expected gradual attenuation for the three motor-related conditions for the N1 (execution > imagery > observation), but comparable effects for the P2. Our analyses revealed N1 attenuation only for self-performed and visually-cued sounds, while the former was stronger than the latter. For the P2, we observed attenuation of all motor-related and visually-cued sounds. The effect was stronger for sounds following action execution compared to all other conditions, while attenuation was comparable between sounds following imagined and observed actions. Importantly, the effect was stronger for sounds following observed (but not imagined) actions than for visually-cued sounds. While these results suggest functional similarities between executed, imagined, and observed actions, differences in magnitude challenge computational equivalence. Furthermore, they indicate that motor-related prediction might also be reflected in later processing stages (the P2) and not, as previously thought, exclusively in the early N1.","Submitter first name":"Constanze","Submitter last name":"Weber","Submitter (affiliation)":"Heinrich-Heine Universit\u00e4t, D\u00fcsseldorf","Submitter (email)":"constanze.weber@uni-duesseldorf.de","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"477":{"Id":335,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Modeling brain sex in the limbic system to track pubertal development","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Sex differences in the prevalence of common brain disorders oftentimes arise after puberty.

Yet, conceptual frameworks on how perception and action become integrated, like the Theory of Event Coding and Binding and Retrieval in Action Control, still lack the concept of predictability and it is unclear how neural processes may implement predictive coding during dynamic perception-action integration. We show that distinct neurophysiological mechanisms of nonlinearly directed connectivities in the theta and alpha band between cortical structures underlie these processes. The neural processes modulated depend on whether perceptual and motor codes are integrated (bound), or whether they are retrieved during actions. During the integration of perception and motor codes, especially theta band activity in the insular cortex and temporo-hippocampal structures is modulated by the predictability of upcoming information. Here, the insular cortex is guiding processes. For the retrieval of such integrated perception-action codes especially alpha band activity is important. Here directed top-down influence of alpha band activity from orbitofrontal structures on insular and temporo-hippocampal structures is key. Likely, these top-down effects reflect attentional shielding of retrieval processes operating in the same neuroanatomical structures previously involved in the integration of perceptual and motor codes. Through neurophysiology, the present study connects predictive coding mechanisms with frameworks specifying the dynamic integration of perception and action.","Submitter first name":"Roula ","Submitter last name":" Jamous","Submitter (affiliation)":"Roula Jamous","Submitter (email)":"Roula Jamous <roula.jamous1@tu-dresden.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"481":{"Id":339,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"Causal contributions of prefrontal and intraparietal cortices to audiovisual causal inference","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"To obtain coherent multisensory representations of their environment, humans integrate signals across the sensory modalities if they infer that the signals arose from a common cause, but they segregate signals from independent causes.

Participants reporting mild-moderate VIMS depict an increase in delta power in the central-parietal region (CP2) and a decrease in the central region (Cz) compared to participants with minimal VIMS ratings. The time course of variation in the EEG signal suggests that group differences developed over the course of a trial. These results suggest that EEG may be used to discern differences in sensory processing during minimal and mild-moderate VIMS, which ultimately may reflect differential processing of conflicting visual and vestibular sensory information.","Submitter first name":"Stefan ","Submitter last name":" Berti","Submitter (affiliation)":"Stefan Berti (Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz)","Submitter (email)":"Stefan Berti <berti@uni-mainz.de>","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"490":{"Id":348,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"The N400 during proverb listening","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Proverbs are commonly known statements that express an advice or perceived truth.

Hence, they can serve as formidable material to study semantic processing in clinical populations where single-subject results can be highly relevant. Nevertheless, very few studies have investigated electrophysiological correlates of proverb processing, even in healthy populations.\nHere, we recorded ERPs while 18 healthy participants listened to common German proverbs. We varied proverb endings in three conditions: 1. the correct proverb endings (Don\u2019t judge a book by its COVER), 2. a different, but semantically adequate ending (Don\u2019t judge a book by its PAGES), and 3) a semantically and syntactically inadequate proverb ending (Don\u2019t judge a book by its DEEP). We predicted that, in the N400 interval (300 to 500 ms), activations to semantically adequate but incorrect endings are more negative-going than activations to the correct endings, which our data confirmed. We also predicted that the entirely inadequate endings would yield even more negative-going activations than semantically adequate different endings, which surprisingly was not the case.\nIn addition to a typical group-level analysis, we also assessed N400 presence on the single-subject level. Here, only about half of the participants showed a significant N400. This shows that proverb-violations reliably elicit an N400 at the group level but that, even in healthy adults, intact semantic processing is not always statistically detectable with this method at the individual level, challenging an easy transfer into clinical settings.","Submitter first name":"Sebastian ","Submitter last name":"Geukes","Submitter (affiliation)":"Sebastian Geukes (Universit\u00e4t Bielefeld)","Submitter (email)":"Sebastian Geukes <sebastian.geukes@uni-bielefeld.de>","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"491":{"Id":349,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Social and Environmental Neuroscience","Title":"White matter differences in monozygotic twins discordant for obsessive-compulsive disorder","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"One of the man goals of clinical research is to identify the many causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Whether overlapping or segregated timing mechanisms subserve these timing processes is a key neuroscientific question. Neuroimaging studies revealed goal-dependent functional dissociations, mostly at the cortical level. However, recent behavioral work hints to computational overlap.  Moreover, separate lines of research have implicated the cerebellum in both explicit and implicit interval timing, but whether this reflects one shared or two context-specific cerebellar mechanisms is unknown. Here, we investigated how the cerebellum might act as a central timing circuit in both tasks and causally control cortical neural dynamics. Cerebellar Ataxia (CA) patients (N=20) and age-matched neurotypical controls (N=12) performed explicit (temporal discrimination) and implicit (temporally cued speeded detection) interval timing tasks while recording scalp EEG. Two intervals (S1, S2) were sequentially presented: S1 was either short (700ms) or long (1200ms), while S2 spanned between the short and long S1. Behaviorally, CA patients were impaired compared to healthy controls in both tasks, showing lower temporal sensitivity in temporal discrimination and smaller validity effect in temporal orienting. Critically, the degree of impairment significantly correlated in the patient group when S1 was short. Moreover, EEG analysis revealed that S1-dependent adjustment of proactive ramping activity (i.e. CNV potential) was abolished in patients in explicit timing, mirroring previous findings in implicit timing. These findings point towards the cerebellum as a central sub-second interval timing hub, affecting the encoding of intervals independently of the final timing purpose.","Submitter first name":"Chiara ","Submitter last name":" Zanonato","Submitter (affiliation)":"Chiara Zanonato (Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T\u00fcbingen, Germany; University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany)","Submitter (email)":null,"Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"493":{"Id":351,"Type":"Poster ","Topic":"Disorders and Interventions","Title":"Voxel-wise intrinsic measures in sensorimotor cortices characterises substance use disorders: An ALE meta-analysis","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Substance use disorders are serious psychiatric illnesses that tend to be chronic, with frequent relapses and high treatment demands.

We meta-analytically integrated the VIMs regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), voxel-mirrored homotopy connectivity (VMHC), and degree centrality (DC) across different SUD populations using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm.

Participants evaluated the emotional valence of ambiguous facial expressions, i.e. rating the expressions as positive or negative, in two experiments, one utilizing artificial facial expressions and the other natural facial expressions. In a univariate analysis, differences in the oscillations of the later rated valence of the faces were observed in both experiments.

The present study explores the interplay and interferences of natural movements (i.e., variations in gait parameters) and communication behaviour (i.e., conversation complexity) in a cohort of healthy ageing individuals in two settings: a controlled, lab-hallway environment and a more volatile, sensorily rich outside walk. In both settings, participants undergo passive listening, speech-in-noise testing, and partake actively in a natural, turn-taking conversation. Spoken audio by participant and experimenter are separated using DNNs and analysed quantitatively and linguistically. Motion sensors worn behind the ear provide gait information (i.e., gait velocity). The electroencephalogram (EEG) allows us to estimate temporal response functions (TRFs) in response to audio input. Using regularised linear models, the multimodal, multi-environment setup enables the analysis of turn-taking (speech latencies, speech pauses, and speech tempo) and the exploration of autocorrelative patterns in gait parameters, EEG parameters, and speech audio. Initial results (N = 5) show that plausible gait parameters can be measured and that participants walked faster in the lab-hallway compared to outside, except for the speech-in-noise task. There was also a tendency for longer speech gaps and more speech overlap in the outdoor condition, indicating less smooth turn-taking.  Initial results show TRF-typical component structure for passive listening.

So far, the face-selective response elicited by this paradigm has mostly relied on stimuli of very complex nature: As such, the classic set of stimuli used may not be adequate for individuals with low visual acuity (e.g., very young infants). We thus developed a novel stimulus set maintaining most properties of the classic set, but ensuring a less-patterned background and higher contrast between the item and its background to enhance figure-ground segregation. We recorded the scalp EEG of 19 adults while they watched 35-sec-long sequences of stimuli at a fast rate of 6 Hz (i.e., each image lasting 167ms) with faces displayed as every 6th stimulus (i.e., at a 1-Hz rate: 1-sec interval). Sequences counterbalanced the classic and new sets using either normal or phase-scrambled stimuli. While both stimulus sets yielded equivalent responses for scrambled stimuli confirming an absence of low-level confounds, the 1-Hz face-selective response presented a stronger amplitude in the new set along with more robust individual and trial-by-trial indices. In addition, preliminary data collected in 2-month-old (N = 14) and 5-month-old (N = 24) infants using the same sequences of classic vs new sets, followed the same trend with a stronger face-selective response in the new set at both ages.

However, only a limited number of studies have examined the neural mechanisms underlying this so-called Irrelevant Speech Effect (ISE). The ISE has been attributed to attentional capture and the interference between pre-attentive, automatic sound processing and deliberate processes involved in retaining memory lists. Previous EEG studies focused on sensory processing pertaining to auditory distractors within the irrelevant sound paradigm, whereas the neural correlates of the adverse impacts of task-irrelevant sounds on the to-be-remembered visually presented items are less well understood.\n\nIn order to further explore the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of visually presented items during task-irrelevant speech, we conducted an analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to foreign speech and pink noise in a sample of 43 young adults. Participants were instructed to immediately reconstruct a series of visually presented verbal items. In line with previous findings, we observed a decline in recall performance when participants were exposed to speech. Furthermore, more negative N1 amplitudes in the speech compared to the pink noise condition were observed. By contrast, no significant differences in P3a amplitude were identified between speech and pink noise. These findings highlight that task-irrelevant speech affects early sensory processing and attentional modulation, but not later cognitive processing like attentional orientation.

Previous studies on working memory and episodic memory have shown that older adults have relatively intact memory for individual stimuli (e.g., shape, image), while their memory for the spatial context in which a stimulus occurs (i.e., item-position binding) is impaired dramatically. Here, we extend this research in two ways: first, we study joint item-position memory for ordered sequences; second, we investigate how blocked versus interleaved learning curricula affect memory of item, position and joint sequences for older versus younger adults. Across two behavioral experiments with 108 younger (18-35 years) and 100 older (over 65 years) adults, we found better memory for item sequences than position sequences and worst performance for joint item-position sequence reports in both age-groups. Notably, age differences followed the same pattern, being least pronounced for sequential item memory and most for joint item-position sequences. Changing the learning curriculum such that either item or position sequences repeated across trials, rather than occurring in an interleaved fashion, improved memory performance in both age groups, but had a stronger effect on older than younger adults. A preliminary computational modeling analysis demonstrated that performance is best explained by a sequential item-position binding process rather than independent item and position sequence encoding processes. Notably, the learning curriculum modulated the relative dominance of the context binding. Future work will focus on dissociating the relative contribution of the two encoding strategies and explore how they connect to optimal reallocation of limited cognitive resources with age.","Submitter first name":"Xiangjuan ","Submitter last name":" Ren","Submitter (affiliation)":"Xiangjuan Ren","Submitter (email)":"Xiangjuan Ren <xiangjuan.ren@uni-hamburg.de>","Gender":"female=2, male=3","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"519":{"Id":380,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"The effect of context variability on serial dependence in speech perception","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Perception not only depends on the current sensory input but also on the perceptual history, an effect called serial dependence. While research in serial dependence has mainly focused on the visual domain, we investigated how context variability in sensory history affects the perception of auditory vowel stimuli. In three experimental setups with varying context variability, sequences of vowels spoken by different speakers were presented while participants indicated by keypress which vowel they perceived. Crucially, the inclusion of not just the clear vowel but also different levels of ambiguous morphed vowels allowed for the necessary response variation to unravel an otherwise conflated pattern of stimulus and choice history. Our results corroborate the theory that perception is shaped by two intertwined and opposing processes of sensory and choice history. Sensory history exerted a repulsive effect pushing the current perception away from the previous stimulus, while choice history attracted the current perception towards the previous response. The direction of the effects could only be uncovered once both sensory and decisional processes were taken into account. Further, we observed that the repulsive effect of sensory history scaled linearly with context variability, whereas the effect of choice history follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. These findings suggest that lower-level sensory mechanisms, akin to adaptation, drive the repulsive sensory history effect, while higher-level processes are responsible for the attractive influence of choice history. These results point to a fundamental mechanism operating across both visual and auditory modalities, showcasing the intricate interaction of serial effects in perception.","Submitter first name":"Carina ","Submitter last name":" Ufer","Submitter (affiliation)":"Carina Ufer (UKE)","Submitter (email)":"Carina Ufer <carina.ufer@uni-hamburg.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"520":{"Id":381,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Development and Aging","Title":"Examining the influence of efficacy and reward on cognitive control across development","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Cognitive control is essential for accomplishing tasks, but it requires mental effort.

In a first  step, to generate new photo stimuli, we took pictures of appreciative, critical, and neutral facial expressions from 30 models using three different instruction techniques (method acting, imitation of prototypical expressions, and scene-induced expressions). In a second step, to select stimuli for the final database, we conducted a validation study in which 33 participants rated the extent to which they recognized appreciation vs. critique in the photographed expressions. Overall, the identification rate of images according to the intended expression was 91.93 % (appreciation: 87.67 %, critique: 96.06 %, neutral: 91.08 %). Based on the ratings, we selected the images with the highest identification rates to be included in the final data base. The resulting FACES-AC includes 54 images, comprising pictures from 18 models (9 female, 9 male), each showing 3 expressions (appreciation, critique, neutral) and is available  for use in experimental research.","Submitter first name":"Ronja ","Submitter last name":"Ochs","Submitter (affiliation)":"Ronja Ochs","Submitter (email)":"Ronja Ochs <ronja.ochs@gmx.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"522":{"Id":383,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Learning, Memory, and Sleep","Title":"Retrieval-based learning benefits vocabulary learning in school children","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Vocabulary learning is a critical skill children need to develop and practice regularly.

In the current study, we investigated whether the pupil\u2019s response to decision outcome (i.e., feedback) in the context of associative learning reflects a prediction error as defined by KL divergence, while also exploring the time course of this prediction error signal. To do so, we adapted a simple model of trial-by-trial learning of stimulus probabilities based on information theory from previous literature. We analyzed two data sets in which participants performed perceptual decision-making tasks that required associative learning while pupil dilation was recorded. Our findings showed that a significant proportion of variability in the post-feedback pupil response during decision-making can be explained by formal quantifications of KL divergence shortly after feedback presentation in both task contexts. Interestingly, the variability explained by the Shannon surprise and entropy differed over time with respect to feedback onset and (qualitatively) between the different task contexts. This study provides experimental evidence for the link between post-feedback pupil dilation and information gain and furthermore demonstrates the potential for using this accessible physiological marker to study internal belief states during decision-making.","Submitter first name":"Olympia ","Submitter last name":"Colizoli","Submitter (affiliation)":"Olympia Colizoli (Radboud University)","Submitter (email)":"Olympia Colizoli <olympia.colizoli@donders.ru.nl>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"525":{"Id":386,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Computational Methods and Neuroimaging","Title":"Derivation of the Default Mode Network using a clinical language-fMRI in people with epilepsy","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Resting-state (rs) functional connectivity can be measured using rs-fMRI.

Since functional connectivity in rs-networks (e.g. the default mode network [DMN]) in PwE can be altered, we aimed to validate the method of extracting the DMN from a task dependent fMRI in PwE. Data of 92 PwE who had both rs-fMRI and a task-based fMRI (language fMRI) were analysed using ICA-, similarity- and ROI-to-ROI-analyses.

While the ERN and Pe indicate immediate error processing in single-stage tasks, the present study investigated whether these components reflect the tracking and contextualization of errors across stages of a multistage task.

With an EEG study, we focused on the sensory and motor-preparatory ERPs and behavioral consequences of these movements in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Participants made active (self-initiated, 700 ms lower limit), quick (respond to a cue as quickly as possible) and passive (finger moved by device) button presses that triggered two consecutively presented visual discs of equal brightness, and they needed to judge which of the discs was brighter. Behaviorally, drift-diffusion modeling suggests the highest drift rate (i.e., fastest information accumulation) for the quick condition. For ERPs, in the motor preparation time window, the quick condition also elicited the lowest readiness potential. However, the lateralized readiness potential was lower for both the active and the quick conditions than the passive condition. For the sensory N1-P2 elicited by the first stimulus, both the active and quick conditions also showed lower amplitude than the passive condition. Importantly, none of these ERPs differ between the trials that have chosen the first vs. the second stimulus. Rather, weighted permutation entropy (measuring neural variability of the EEG at electrodes C3, C4, and Cz during motor preparation) was sensitive to this comparison, but this sensitivity did not differ between movement types.

Probabilities had to be learnt through trial and error, while magnitudes were explicitly provided. In addition, reward contingencies changed over the course of the experiment, involving stable and more uncertain, volatile phases. In study 1, we administered the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden to 43 healthy participants (placebo-controlled, within-subject design). Biperiden significantly reduced sensitivity to learnt reward probabilities, especially in the volatile phases when uncertainty was highest. Computational modeling revealed that this effect was explained by increased learning rates under biperiden and not merely due to a diminished sensitivity to learnt information about probability. In study 2, we administered the GABA<sub>A<\/sub> agonist lorazepam, the partial NMDA agonist d-cycloserine, and placebo (60 participants). Lorazepam, similar to biperiden, reduced sensitivity to task attributes. However, here, the explicitly provided magnitude information had reduced influence on decisions, while the impact of the learnt attribute was not affected. These lorazepam effects were independent of uncertainty level. D-cycloserine showed no discernible effects in this study. In sum, biperiden and lorazepam exhibited distinct effects in the same learning task, pointing at distinct mechanistic roles for muscarinic acetylcholine and GABA<sub>A<\/sub> receptors in reward-guided learning and decision making under varying degrees of uncertainty.","Submitter first name":"Monja ","Submitter last name":"Frob\u00f6se","Submitter (affiliation)":"Monja Frob\u00f6se (Institute of Experimental Psychology, Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf)","Submitter (email)":"Monja Frob\u00f6se <monja.froboese@hhu.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"530":{"Id":391,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Learning, Memory, and Sleep","Title":": How does reward affect neighbouring items in a graph learning paradigm","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Which memories are remembered and which forgotten has long been a key question of memory research.

Previous research report reward-modulation of memory not only of rewarded items, but that reward effects also diffuse to nearby unrewarded items graded by their distance to the reward. Additionally, it has been shown that when items embedded into a graph structure are learned (e.g. as is the case for a cognitive map) graph topology (e.g. centrality) influences memory retention. However, to this point, the neurophsyiological correlates of these processes are unknown.  In a pilot experiment, to validate our study paradigm, we performed an online experiment including 100 participants. Participants learned pair-wise associations of 15 interconnected nodes, which were embedded in a hidden graph structure. Within the graph, one pair was reinforced with a monetary reward. The graph was setup such that three minimally connected communities containing each 5 nodes emerged. While data analysis is still ongoing, we expect that pairs near the rewarded pair would show increased retention. Additionally, we expect that reward would diffuse stronger within local communities.

In auditory perception, previous studies found a mismatch between acoustic and perceptual onsets (P-Centers) for speech and non-speech complex sounds. P-Centers, occurring after acoustic onsets, are consistent across individual listeners but do not align to any simple acoustic landmark. However, the precision and timing of P-Center perception in speech, and its dependency on sound complexity, remain unclear. \nTo address this, we employ an iterative adjustment paradigm (IAP). Participants hear isochronous 4-beat sequences, followed by a target word (speech condition) or a fifth metronome beat (non-speech condition). Target word P-Centers, based on recordings of the words synchronized with a metronome, are either aligned on-beat or offset by up to +-95ms. After hearing the sequence, participants shift the target to fall on beat using a slider. They then listen to the adjusted sequence and can iteratively re-adjust until the sequence sounds isochronous.\nPreliminary results (n=10) suggest enhanced sensitivity to P-Center deviations in simple non-speech sounds compared to speech, with final deviations influenced by initial offsets. Adjustment dynamics suggest incremental approximation towards an internal P-Center representation. Planned follow-up studies will (1) validate sensitivity thresholds for P-Centers in the IAP as compared to a classical staircase approach and (2) elucidate the source of sensitivity differences for speech and non-speech sounds.","Submitter first name":"Charlotte ","Submitter last name":"Mock","Submitter (affiliation)":"Charlotte Mock","Submitter (email)":"Charlotte Mock <charlotte.mock@uni-tuebingen.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"534":{"Id":395,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Cognition","Title":"Neural dynamics of predicting others' decisions","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Converging evidence suggests that people often predict the behaviour of other individuals by imagining what they themselves might do next in such a situation \u2013 essentially simulating the other\u2019s future hypothetical behaviour with their own mind.

It remains however unclear how these representations might regulate human behavior. To address this issue, healthy participants were subjected to a virtual reality cue-in-context conditioning paradigm divided into three stages. During the first phase (context encoding), participants were invited to actively explore three virtual offices two minutes each. The contexts were furnished differently except for two stimuli (one yellow and one blue lamp). During the second phase (fear acquisition), participants were teleported into  two of the three offices alternately multiple times. In one office, one lamp (e.g., the yellow one) was associated with an electric stimulation (unconditioned stimulus, US), while the other lamp (e.g., the blue one) was not. In the other office, contingencies were reversed. In the third phase (behavioral test), participants actively explored again all the virtual contexts. Subjective ratings, autonomic responses, movement trajectories and gaze behavior were recorded. Preliminary findings indicate successful contingency learning. Furthermore, we observed physiological signatures indicative of a shift from an elemental towards a contextual representation during aversive learning. This finding is substantiated by an avoidance pattern concerning the location of the aversively conditioned cues in the behavioral test phase.

This project has incorporated qualitative and quantitative approaches towards reproducible and comparable sexuality research. First, a narrative literature review has been conducted to give comparative information on the currently available sets to summarize strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, building on this knowledge, a new openly accessible standardized explicit pornography picture set (EPPS) has been created paying special attention to prior shortcomings regarding heteronormative representations and limited sexual diversity offering affective ratings of valence, arousal, dominance, disgust, moral and ethical acceptance. Lastly, the EPPS (opposite- and same-sex images) has been employed in a high-density magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometric study for a passive viewing task in healthy hetero- and homosexual women and men. In addition, clinical indicators of compulsive sexual behaviors (sexual sensation seeking, hypersexuality, problematic pornography use, time spent on pornography) were co-assessed.

Moreover, in line with prior studies, we observed a significant decrease in self-reported pain perception post-HIIT compared to pre-HIIT. Additionally, a decrease of measured oxyhemoglobin levels was evident in both the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex post-HIIT compared to pre-HIIT levels. Notably, the degree of reported pain reduction correlated with the decrease in oxyhemoglobin levels specifically in the prefrontal cortex indicating its critical involvement in modulating EIH responses. \nIn conclusion, our study illuminates the potential neuronal mechanisms underlying EIH, highlighting the pivotal role of reduced oxyhemoglobin levels in the prefrontal cortex post-HIIT as a significant contributor to subjective pain reduction, explaining over fifty percent of the observed variance. This reduction in oxyhemoglobin levels during painful stimulation post-HIIT may be a consequence of heightened oxyhemoglobin levels in the prefrontal cortex during the HIIT session itself.

However, evidence linking motor prediction to sensory processing is scarce. Here, we leveraged ERP and EEG-based MVPA methods to examine the action-perception relationship. Participants made active (self-initiated) or passive (finger moved by electromagnet) button presses that triggered a simultaneous auditory and visual stimulus. This was followed, in a block-wise manner, by a unimodal auditory\/visual stimulus and participants judged which stimulus was brighter or louder. Univariate ERP results suggested that the readiness potential encoded task modality, showing specific preparation for the upcoming task-relevant stimulus. Sensory ERPs showed lower peak amplitudes (N1) and reduced task differences (N1-P2) for active, demonstrating sensory suppression. In our MVPA analysis, we decoded task modality within active and passive conditions, based on the broadband EEG time-locked to the button press. During motor preparation (400 ms before the button press), the active condition showed higher decoding accuracy, presumably reflecting enhanced predictive processes in this condition. Conversely, in the sensory perception period (100 to 400 ms after stimulus onset), decoding accuracy was higher in the passive condition, mirroring previous reports of reduced sensory responses for self-generated stimuli. Moreover, temporal generalization showed that that the neural pattern of the alpha band amplitude within the motor preparation and the stimulus perception windows were cross-decodable. This finding suggests that alpha oscillations may encode sensory predictions that were generated during motor preparation. Our finding provides novel mechanistic evidence for sensory-outcome predictions during voluntary actions.","Submitter first name":"Edward","Submitter last name":"Ody","Submitter (affiliation)":"Edward Ody (University of Marburg)","Submitter (email)":"Edward Ody <edward.ody@uni-marburg.de>","Gender":"male = 4","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"545":{"Id":407,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Development and Aging","Title":"Individual Differences in Resting-State EEG Markers of Dementia and Normal Aging","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Cognitive decline is associated with changes in EEG resting-state parameters.

One hundred and fifty-two subjects (72 SP, 82 CG) underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The SP subjects also participated in a one-session treatment in which they approached and touched a spider under therapeutic guidance.

In the absence of stimulation, this connection appears to be explicitly reduced in SP, whereas the visuomotor connection is increased, which might promote a rapid response to threat.

According to the theoretical underpinning of the ATT (Wells et al., 2011) and neurocognitive theories of mental disorders (Cole et al. 2014), we expect that the ATT leads to activation in cognitive control areas, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).\n\nMethod: We used an adapted ATT paradigm in N=40 healthy participants during fMRI, comparing selective attention and rapid attention switching to passive listening. Subjective effort and attention ratings and a parallel random number generation task was included in part of the trials, in order to quantify AC demands during the task.\n\nResults: Compared to passive listening, ATT conditions exhibited increased activation in the dlPFC as well as in regions of the salience, auditory and visual networks, and decreased activation in the default mode network (pFWE<.05).

While reducing overall task effects, randomness in the parallel RNG task successfully differentiated between task conditions (p<.05). \n\nConclusions: This fMRI adapted ATT paradigm is suited to investigate ATT-related neural brain responses in the dlPFC and other networks previously related to repetitive thinking.

Recently, a computational model postulated that the ratio between excitation and inhibition in neuronal networks (E:I ratio) can be inferred from the spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum. Specifically, the model predicted a flattening of the spectral slope in states of hyper-excitability. To date, it remains unknown whether this model generalizes to clinically-relevant states of hyper-excitability such as epileptic seizures. Here, we analyzed seizures recorded via intracranial electroencephalography from epilepsy patients. We tested whether aperiodic activity correlates with seizure dynamics. Spectral slope and offset were estimated via a linear fit to the power spectra of seizure conditions (resting-state, preictal, ictal, postictal) in epileptic zones (seizure onset zone [SOZ], propagation zone [PZ], non-involved zone [NIZ]). Additionally, we examined how signal sharpness affects aperiodic activity. Contrary to the model predictions, the spectral slope steepened during the ictal condition in the (pathologic) SOZ and PZ, but not in the (non-pathologic) NIZ. In contrast, the NIZ displayed a flattening of the spectral slope during the preictal as compared to the resting-state condition. Notably, we observed that the ictal steepening of the spectral slope was a direct consequence of increased signal sharpness. Overall, we found that aperiodic activity tracks seizure progression and propagation, but also correlates with signal sharpness in pathologic samples. We propose to reinterpret the spectral slope for pathologic samples. In non-pathologic samples, the spectral slope may provide complementary insights into neuronal population activity shaping seizure dynamics.","Submitter first name":"Laura ","Submitter last name":"Heidiri","Submitter (affiliation)":"Laura Heidiri","Submitter (email)":"Laura Heidiri <laura.heidiri@uni-tuebingen.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"552":{"Id":414,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"Long-term contextual dependencies determine whether non-speech contexts induce rate normalization effects in speech perception","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Auditory word perception depends on contextual speech rate. In German, a fixed vowel duration is perceived as long in a fast speech context, but as short in slower speech contexts, known as rate normalization (RN). For example, perception of \/ban\/ changes from \u2018Bahn\u2019 (\u2018a train\u2019, long \/a\/) to \u2018Bann\u2019 (\u2018a spell\u2019, short \/a\/) when the preceding context is slowed. Whether RN relies on speech-specific or domain-general mechanisms is debated, as the evidence for RN in non-speech contexts is mixed. In a series of three experiments, we compared RN induced by speech and non-speech contexts with varying spectro-temporal similarity to speech: low-pass-filtered speech and isochronous sequences of either pure (440 Hz) or complex (\/u\/ vowel) tones, presented at a fast (5.7 Hz) or a slow (2.8 Hz) rate. Experiment 1 replicated the speech-induced RN effect and showed that pure tones similarly induced RN. In Experiment 2, complex tones but not low-pass-filtered speech induced RN. Crucially, RN induced by pure and complex tone sequences did not significantly differ from that of speech. Surprisingly, when complex tones were presented in isolation from other contexts in Experiment 3, their effect vanished. Exploratory re-analysis of Experiment 2 showed that complex tones induced a reliable effect when presented after low-pass-filtered speech. By contrast, low-pass-filtered speech induced a reliable RN effect before exposure to complex tones that vanished afterwards, explaining the null effect in the across-block analysis. Overall, our results show that RN induction by non-speech contexts depends on long-term acoustic contexts.","Submitter first name":"Andrey ","Submitter last name":" Zyryanov","Submitter (affiliation)":"Andrey Zyryanov (University of Tuebingen)","Submitter (email)":"Andrey Zyryanov <andrey.zyryanov@uni-tuebingen.de>","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"553":{"Id":415,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Disorders and Interventions","Title":"Exposure to relaxation-associated odors during sleep reduces sleep spindles in people with frequent nightmares","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Around 5% of the general population experience frequent nightmares, which are associated with cortical hyperarousal, i.e. increased high-frequency EEG activity during sleep. Experimental manipulation of cortical hyperarousal may help clarify its mechanistic role in nightmare occurrence and lead to new interventions. Initial studies indicate that relaxation interventions can be reactivated during sleep using memory cues and influence sleep in healthy subjects. In this study, we investigated whether relaxation-associated odor cues during sleep affect cortical hyperarousal, sleep spindles and nightmare symptoms.\n25 (mean age = 24.94(5.01)) participants (\u22651 nightmare \/ week) practiced a deep-breathing relaxation exercise for one week coupled with an odor. In two subsequent nights in the sleep lab with 64-channel high density EEG, the associated odor or a control odor were presented in randomized order. \nThe relaxation exercise led to reduced beta and gamma activity and an increase in subjective relaxation ratings. The exposure to relaxation-associated odor cues during sleep did not have comparable effects. Spindle count and density were substantially reduced when relaxation-associated odor cues were presented. Nightmare symptoms did not change over time or when comparing reactivation to control nights.\nContrary to our hypotheses, we found no effects of reactivating a relaxation exercise on cortical hyperarousal. However, the substantial reduction in sleep spindles indicates a reactivation of relaxation contents is possible. Sleep spindles are increased in nightmare patients and a reduction may suggest that nightmare-related processes were positively influenced. Future research should include longer reactivation periods and the reactivation of other interventions, e.g. imagery rehearsal therapy.","Submitter first name":"Clara ","Submitter last name":"Sayk","Submitter (affiliation)":"Clara Sayk (Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, Translational Psychiatry Unit)","Submitter (email)":"Clara Sayk <clarasayk@gmail.com>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"554":{"Id":416,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Affective Neuroscience","Title":"Sex hormones and Empathy: A Systematic Review","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Empathy can be described as an experience of emotional sharing between two individuals: a target and an observer, whereby the perception of the target\u2019s emotional state leads to a similar state in the observer.

In our review, we investigate the potential role that the primary sex hormones - estrogen, progesterone and testosterone may play in empathic processing. The widely held assumption that women are by default more empathetic, may be prone to social and cultural gender expectations, which misinterprets and overemphasizes the true extent of sex differences and ultimately, prevents successful disentanglement of the biological root of empathy from social influence. By using endocrinological measures as a tool, hormonally mediated differences in empathy, and thus the true extent of sex differences, can be uncovered. Our systematic review summarizes the current scope of the research on the influence of sex hormones on empathic processing, looking at empathic measures across self-reported, behavioural, physiological, and neuroscientific data. Included manuscripts investigated sex hormones from several avenues, including 1) Endogenous levels of sex hormones 2) Exogenously manipulated sex hormones such as hormonal contraception, or gender reaffirming therapy and 3) Natural fluctuations of ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle.

Previous findings associate craving with pupil dilatation, an indicator of noradrenergic activity potentially, linked to cue-induced incentive motivation. Furthermore, escalating behaviors have previously been associated with impulsivity and compulsivity. \nUsing a computational psychiatry approach, this project aims to mechanistically understand the cognitive processes that drive these pathological escalating behaviors. For this purpose, we will recruit a total of ninety patients with either AUD, GD or BED, i.e. thirty per group and ninety matched healthy control subjects. We use an established task (Konova et al., 2018), that uses a food cue to induce food craving and tests the extent to which this alters value-based decision-making. As food craving is specific to BED but general to AUD and GD we can test whether craving generalizes across diagnostic boundaries. In addition, pupillometry will be performed as part of an eye-tracking session. All participants will also complete additional tasks and questionnaires associated with different facets of impulsivity and compulsivity to further elucidate the mechanisms associated with cue-induced craving.

Twenty healthy young adults underwent tTIS and sham stimulation in two separate sessions.

Here we used EEG to test the influence of stimulus saliency (as one aspect of sensory evidence) on neural processes underlying audiovisual spatial integration. A tone was flanked by two visual stimuli of different sizes (and thus different saliency levels). Participants were asked to localize the tone. The perceived shift from the actual auditory location towards the bigger visual stimulus was assessed as a behavioral measure of bottom-up effects on audio-visual spatial binding. Results showed a behavioral effect of visual saliency on auditory localization (i.e., a ventriloquist effect toward the bigger visual stimulus). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were affected by the side (left or right of auditory stimulus) of the more salient visual stimulus in early (around 100 ms post-stimulus) and late (around 400 ms post-stimulus) time windows at occipital-parietal electrode sites. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect between the side of the more salient visual stimulus and the size of the behavioral ventriloquist effect between 260 and 400 ms post-stimulus in frontal electrodes.

The current fMRI study investigated whether older adults' emphasis on pre-existing semantic knowledge at encoding impaired visual encoding while increasing false recognition, as well as the brain regions engaged.

Data suggests that older adults with lower specificity of visual representations in combination with higher specificity of semantic representations falsely recognised more fonts. 2) Encoding-retrieval similarity revealed that the reduction of specificity of the encoded fonts in aging in the meaningful condition is reflected as an increased neural pattern similarity in the early visual cortex.

Independent of these developments, the role of re-iterant processes is increasingly debated in cognitive psychology when it comes to the understanding of perception-action integration processes. Connecting these lines of research, this study examined the relevance of re-iterant neural activity for cognitive mechanisms underlying perception-action integration. For this, a sample of N = 42 healthy adults were examined in memory-based task switching paradigm. Power- and representation-based analyses of the EEG data were employed with a focus on theta band activity (TBA) and alpha band activity (ABA). The performed analyses, revealed distinct neuroanatomical structures and neural dynamics during perception-action integration. Importantly, while power-based analyses highlighted the relevance of ABA in different time frames and underscored the importance of ABA-related control on task set maintenance and attentional preparatory processes during perception-action integration, representation-based analyses provided a more nuanced pattern.

Prior studies highlight uncertainty and valence, noting reward processing deficits in depression, uncertainty response impairments in anxiety and generally impaired learning and decision-making in ADHD. Yet, gaps persist in understanding the developmental trajectory of psychopathological effects, the generalizability of findings across diverse contexts due to task heterogeneity in adult studies, and the nuanced impact of individual symptom severity, often overlooked in case-control designs. \nThis study contributes to the emerging field of developmental computational psychiatry by addressing three key challenges. First, it investigates the relatively uncharted territory of psychopathology during developmental stages. Second, it seeks to reconcile task heterogeneity by employing a systematic approach to task conditions, enabling broader contextual generalizations. Third, it adopts a dimensional approach to examine the effects of symptom severity across depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In a sample of clinical (n=62) and typically developing (n=60) individuals aged 8 to 18 years, our study systematically evaluates the dimensional effects of depression, anxiety, and ADHD symptoms. We incorporate various conditions of uncertainty and valence within our task paradigm to elucidate the generalizability of identified effects. Our findings provide compelling evidence that symptom-related alterations in learning and decision-making manifest in children as young as 8 years old, despite ongoing developmental changes.

In two experiments, we investigated the role of XAI in the human learning process using a house rent estimation task. This task involved five phases: pre-assistance, early assistance, late assistance, post-assistance, and transfer phases. Participants engaged in 20 trials for each phase, estimating rental prices based on varying house features. Experiment 1(N=248) utilized simulated house rental prices, with three groups receiving different levels of AI support: XAI-supported, AI-supported, and no AI support (feedback of real prices only). Results showed that the XAI-supported group demonstrated smaller estimation errors compared to the other two groups, particularly in the late assistance post-assistance and transfer phase, indicating that XAI can aid humans in making complex decisions.

Present theories regarding AN propose that these behaviors aimed at controlling weight are the result of an abnormal response to rewards or an overemphasis on cognitive control.

These findings underscore the importance of cognitive overcontrol in driving the distinctive behaviors associated with the disorder. It also points to the necessity of developing therapeutic strategies aimed at channeling the remarkable, albeit dysfunctional, determination and perseverance shown by those affected by AN towards more constructive behavioral changes.","Submitter first name":"Michaela ","Submitter last name":" Ohme","Submitter (affiliation)":"Michaela Ohme","Submitter (email)":"Michaela Ohme <michaela.ohme@ukdd.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"578":{"Id":441,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Individual Differences and (Epi)Genetics","Title":"Epigenetic signatures of childhood maltreatment in a high-risk sample - a replication study","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Childhood maltreatment (CM) has long-lasting effects on physical and mental health.

In case, this activation turned out to be false, i.e. when distractor and target are incongruent, a pronounced negative deflection emerged. Here, we provide an update of this N2 effect by new data from a different lab. In contrast to previous studies, we varied proportion congruency (PC) in three levels (25%, 50%, or 75% congruent trials within a block) and we also considered congruency sequence (aka conflict adaptation) effects. As expected, the amplitude of the N2 elicited in incongruent trials increased with PC level, arguably reflecting the degree of cognitive effort required to resolve the response conflict. Moreover, the N2 for incongruent trials was larger when the previous trial was congruent rather than incongruent. This sequential congruency effect was further modulated by proportion congruency, i.e. larger sequential congruency effects in the 75% congruency condition compared to the 50% and 25% congruency conditions. In conclusion, the temporal flanker task in combination with a proportion congruency manipulation consistently evokes target-related N2 congruency effects.

However, research suggests that the effects of interruptions can be mitigated in several ways, such as alerting cues and preparation time. Here, we used a retrospective visual working memory task to investigate the effects of duration and flexible resumption after interruptions, with 28 young (18-30 years old) participants attending the experiment. This task was sometimes interrupted with an arithmetic task that was presented before the retro-cue, and the period after the interruptions until the presentation of the retro-cue was either short (no additional time), long (additional 1000 ms), or self-determined; with the fixed duration conditions being balanced within the no-interruptions. Interruptions lowered the main task performance, which could be seen in both angular error and response times, while the latter showing an additional benefit of flexibility even over no-interruptions. Additionally, EEG analysis revealed an overall reduced evoked theta to the retro-cue following interruptions. This reduction in oscillatory response was also visible in alpha suppression following interruptions. But more importantly, for the trials where participants had more time before the retro-cue when they were not interrupted, the alpha power suppression was stronger compared to the short duration trials. Further, this oscillatory response was indistinguishable from the no-interruption conditions when participants were able to self-determine the resumption time. These results indicate that flexibility in task resumption helps reducing the interruption deficits, even boosting the main task performance compared to fixed task resumption.","Submitter first name":"Soner ","Submitter last name":" \u00dclk\u00fc","Submitter (affiliation)":"Soner \u00dclk\u00fc (Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors)","Submitter (email)":"Soner \u00dclk\u00fc <uelkue@ifado.de>","Gender":"male","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"587":{"Id":450,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Brain and Periphery, Neuroendocrinology, and Stress","Title":"Machine Learning-Based Detection of Acute Psychosocial Stress from Digital Biomarkers","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Despite being well established, traditional stress measurement methods are typically difficult to assess.

Temporal expectations can be generated based on various temporal structures, including rhythms and interval memory. The neural entrainment theory postulates that temporal prediction in rhythmic streams uniquely relies on phase-aligning internal neural oscillations to the external rhythm. However, in motor tasks, previous studies found similar behavioral benefits and similar magnitude of neural phase alignment for temporal predictions derived from intervals and rhythms, questioning the unique role of rhythms in these phenomena. Yet, if rhythmic entrainment acts at low-level sensory circuits, its unique effect might only be revealed under high perceptual load. Here we address this using a challenging perceptual discrimination task, in which visual target timing is either non-predictable, is on-beat with a rhythm, or matches a repeated interval. Examining the differential effect of temporal expectation on multiple levels of perception, we collect both \u201cobjective\u201d performance measures and \u201csubjective\u201d visibility reports, a fundamental distinction in consciousness research that has been overlooked in the temporal attention field. In line with previous findings, both interval- and rhythm-based temporal expectation improves behavioral performance compared to the unpredictable stream. However, inconsistent with the idea that sensory phase alignment is unique to rhythm-based temporal expectation, we find a comparable performance improvement between the rhythm and interval conditions. Furthermore, in EEG, we find similar phase modulation of low-frequency oscillations as well as similar suppression of alpha activity across the two conditions, calling into question the unique role of rythmic structures in driving temporal expectations.","Submitter first name":"Christina ","Submitter last name":" Bruckmann","Submitter (affiliation)":"Christina Bruckmann (Max-Planck-Institute for Biological Cybernetics)","Submitter (email)":"Christina Bruckmann <christina.bruckmann@tuebingen.mpg.de>","Gender":"? n angeben","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"590":{"Id":453,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Open, Reproducible and Meta Science","Title":"Interactive Tool for Data Simulation using DAGs","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Data simulations are an important tool in empirical research, facilitating power analyses, checking the robustness of statistical models, checking the effect of unreliable measures, or evaluating the influence of potential unmeasured variables.

Previous research of temporal prediction in uncertain environments has focused on isolated intervals, suggesting a Distributional-Learning (DL) model. Alternatively, Recent studies suggest that oscillatory entrainment could explain predictions in non-isochronous streams. However, in non-deterministic streams, if and under which conditions either of these mechanisms drives prediction is unclear.

Previous studies have shown that planning plays a role in multi-step decision-making and that human participants use a spectrum of approaches in terms of planning depth that fall between what is traditionally known as model-free and model-based behavior in reinforcement learning. However, there is little evidence on the exact strategies utilized to represent the same structure when learning to plan in a hierarchical graph structure, and how these strategies affect performance. To this end, we conduct an experiment where participants carry out a four-step planning task in a tree structure with deterministic state transitions and follow-up tasks in which they are asked to judge the similarity between any two states in the four-step task and to build the structure they believe was present in it. We find that participants represent the hierarchy present in the decision tree in both the four-step task and in their similarity judgments. Most participants represent the tree by dividing it into two main branches, while some represent it more temporally, by judging states that occur at the same stage as more similar. We are also interested in how replay is involved in such flexible hierarchical planning that we investigate in an fMRI experiment based on the same task, tracking the reactivation of task states during short on-task pauses. This study will shed light on replay mechanisms used by individuals with different behavioral planning depths and strategies.","Submitter first name":"Rena ","Submitter last name":"Bayramova","Submitter (affiliation)":"Rena Bayramova (Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences)","Submitter (email)":"Rena Bayramova <bayramova@cbs.mpg.de>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"yES","Notes Sebastian":null},"599":{"Id":462,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Development and Aging","Title":"Attention modulation of acute pain in aging \u2013 is high or low cognitive load more effective in distraction from pain in older adults?","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Older people, suffering from pain and its consequences more often than younger people, would benefit significantly from non-pharmacological pain treatment. So far, little is known about how age affects psychological pain modulation strategies. Preliminary findings hint towards a less efficient pain inhibition through cognition-based pain modulation strategies, as cognitive distraction from pain. \nWe investigated the impact of cognitive load on cognitive distraction from pain in aging. In a two-session design, healthy young (18-30 years) and older participants (60+ years) performed a pain distraction task in both sessions, namely a n-Back working memory task with low (0-Back) and high cognitive load (2-Back), during which participants received individually adjusted transdermal electrical pulse trains in non-painful and moderately painful intensities to the inner forearm. Ratings of intensity and unpleasantness were collected, and pain-related evoked potentials were recorded with a 64-channel EEG. Young participants seem to benefit from both low and high cognitive load in the n-Back task similarly with respect to pain relief. Unexpectedly, first analyses suggest a more efficient pain relief through distraction under low relative to high cognitive load in older adults. Moreover, older participants seem to be less able to distinguish between non-painful and painful stimuli when focusing on the pain unrelated cognitive task. Our findings could lead to a better understanding how to adapt pain treatments in this population by including selective cognitive trainings and optimizing distraction task difficulty.","Submitter first name":"Angelika ","Submitter last name":" Dierolf","Submitter (affiliation)":"Angelika Dierolf","Submitter (email)":"Angelika Dierolf <angelika.dierolf@uni.lu>","Gender":"female","Young scientist":"NO","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"NO","Notes Sebastian":null},"600":{"Id":463,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Individual Differences and (Epi)Genetics","Title":"Phenome-wide association study of pain- and anxiety-linked endocannabinoid gene variation FAAH C385A","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Translational studies have identified a common endocannabinoid polymorphism in the FAAH gene that alters endocannabinoid anandamide levels and has been linked to pain, anxiety and brain connectivity.

Two event-related potentials (ERPs), the Reward Positivity (RewP) and the P300, serve as neural correlates of feedback processing in reward-based tasks. While the P300 has been linked to value updating, the RewP is thought to indicate initial sensitivity to rewards. Moreover, research indicates a relation between these ERPs and learning processes. \nMethods: We aimed to investigate feedback processing across two paradigms in patients with internalizing disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder) and control participants without current disorders. Participants completed a guessing game with monetary rewards or losses presented pseudo-randomly. Consecutively, they engaged in a probabilistic reversal learning task, discerning which of two differently colored doors was rewarded. Trial structure, timing, and feedback stimuli were comparable across tasks. Based on previous findings, we anticipated increased RewP amplitudes following rewards and ERP correlations across tasks, as well as group differences in ERP amplitudes. We further explored if learning mechanisms influence P300 and RewP magnitude across groups and the relations between ERPs and self-reported questionnaires.\nResults: Data analysis is ongoing, results from 120 patients and 50 control individuals will be presented. Preliminary findings suggest associations between ERPs across paradigms and modulatory effects of learning on P300 and RewP. Clinical group differences and interactions with task effects will be explored.

However, the causal role of these interactions remains unclear. To provide causal evidence for the role of the amygdala in guiding flexible social-emotional responses, we used a novel non-invasive neurostimulation technique, transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS), in healthy human participants. \n\nParticipants (n = 12, data collection ongoing) underwent three TUS-fMRI sessions in which they received offline TUS targeting bilateral amygdala, insula (control), or sham (counterbalanced).

To address this gap, we conducted a within-subject eye-tracking study (N=61), independently manipulating overall value (OV: sum of option values\/stimulus intensities), value difference (VD: difference between values\/stimulus intensities), and choice domains (i.e., perceptual and preferential choices). Across both choice domains, we found participants made faster decisions without sacrificing accuracy when OV was higher. For eye-tracking data, the number of fixations and fixation durations were significantly reduced from low to high OV. Crucially, we observed a reduction in the gaze-choice association with increasing OV: a reduced tendency to choose the longer fixated option in perceptual choice and a reduced tendency to choose the last fixated option in preferential choice. This reduction was confirmed by model-based analysis. Specifically, fitting the attentional Drift Diffusion Model (aDDM) to behavioral and eye-movement data revealed that the non-fixated option value was discounted least in the high OV condition. Together, our results not only highlight the influence of overall values on gaze patterns and their relation to choices, but also offer a mechanistic account of the puzzling phenomenon that decisions involving options with higher OV tend to be faster yet equally accurate.","Submitter first name":"Chih-Chung ","Submitter last name":"Ting","Submitter (affiliation)":"Chi-Chung Ting","Submitter (email)":"Chih-Chung Ting <chihchung.ting@uni-hamburg.de>","Gender":"male = 2","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"NO","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"604":{"Id":467,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Attention and Perception","Title":"Effects of reward-based attentional bias modification are unspecific for experimental group and explained by habituation","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Attentional biases for socially threatening stimuli have been linked to the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder.

This EEG study employs the Cyberball paradigm to investigate how different combinations of gaze direction and mouth expressions modulate the neural processing of exclusion, specifically through the P300 component. Analysing six groups, we assessed the effects of both isolated and combined manipulations of non-verbal cues. We hypothesized that the direct gaze with happy expressions would mitigate the expected exclusion in the Cyberball task, while an averted gaze with sad expressions would amplify this effect. The results revealed that direct gaze paired with happy expressions significantly lowered the P300 amplitude during the exclusion phase, signalling a mitigated perception of exclusion. Conversely, a neutral gaze aligned with sad expressions modestly reduced the P300 response, suggesting a less pronounced adjustment to exclusion. These findings highlight how gaze and facial expression combinations modify the experience of social exclusion, as the P300 amplitude was found to be context-sensitive to the information conveyed by the eyes and mouth. This insight into the violation of subjective expectations concerning social exclusion emphasizes the significance of non-verbal cues in social interaction and cognitive processing.","Submitter first name":"Yu Fang ","Submitter last name":"Yang","Submitter (affiliation)":"Yu Fang Yang (Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin)","Submitter (email)":"Yu Fang Yang <yu-fang.yang@fu-berlin.de>","Gender":"female = 1, male = 1","Young scientist":"YES","IGOR Prize":"YES","Posterblitz":"NO","Blindanstract":null,"Poster prize":"YES","Notes Sebastian":null},"608":{"Id":473,"Type":"Poster","Topic":"Learning, Memory, and Sleep","Title":"Exploring the Impact of Daytime Light Exposure and Physical Activity on Circadian Rhythms and Sleep: Preliminary Findings from the \u201cHiking-Study\u201d","Mantelabstract":"NO","Abstract":"Exposure to daylight benefits sleep and advances circadian rhythms.

We aim to delineate the effects of daylight exposure and physical activity on the biological clock and sleep. In a 40-h repeated within-subjects protocol, up to 48 healthy participants (currently: N = 13, 9 women; Mage =  24\u00b15 years) undergo three 8-h daylight conditions varying in their effects on ipRGCs: artificial light, natural daylight, and natural daylight with reduced short-wavelength proportions.

Using Bayesian analyses, we only found inconclusive weak evidence for differences between the three light exposure conditions or the two physical activity groups regarding circadian phase shift or sleep.

Spatial separation of a stimulus\u2019 features, however, slowed selection rates by an order of magnitude (3Hz), suggesting time consuming attention-driven binding processes being involved to accomplish discrimination. Though time is evidently a decisive indicator for attentional binding, questions regarding anatomical structures behind it remain.

To pinpoint binding-related cortical activity, we compare trials during which participants were, or were not, successful in reporting correct binding. In replicating previous observations, we find that successful binding appears on average at rates of 4.5Hz. A comparison of SSVEP during successful and unsuccessful trials revealed a difference of source activity in early-mid (V2\/V4) and higher-level (VO1) ventral extrastriate cortex, with successful binding being associated with a tighter phase-link of activity-changes in those regions.
