Using a large sample of participants (n = 156), across four diagnostic groups including obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and a naturalistic control group, we examined the influence of disorder category, clinical status, family risk, and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions (anxious apprehension and anxious arousal). The research objectives and methodology were preregistered prior to data collection (https://osf.io/kxv5h) and the dataset as well as the analytic code have been deposited in an OSF repository (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/7DCM3). Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not observe significant ERN or CRN differences among the diagnostic groups. However, when compared to a strictly defined healthy control group, individuals with specific phobia exhibited a larger ERN, a novel finding. In line with previous work, individuals with a lifetime clinical diagnosis of any internalizing disorder or with a family risk for internalizing psychopathology showed larger ERN and CRN amplitudes. After combining our data with a subclinical sample (n = 246), we identified gender as a moderator, with women exhibiting higher levels of anxious apprehension showing an elevated ERN and CRN. In conclusion, our study challenges the notion of a disorder-specific link to performance monitoring. Instead, our findings suggest that enhanced performance monitoring is associated with a higher propensity for anxious apprehension and acts as a broad risk marker for internalizing psychopathology, reflecting vulnerability beyond diagnostic borders within the anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive spectrum."}}, "1": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "10:45:00", "TalkEnd": "11:00:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Rosa Gr\u00fctzmann", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

Here, we present two studies focusing on different applications of these psychophysiological markers. In study 1, an executive control training targeting the error-related negativity (ERN) was applied in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies have shown that the robust increase of the ERN in OCD might reflect a risk marker and that it persists after cognitive-behavioral therapy despite successful symptom reduction, thus possibly demanding for specifically-tailored interventions. Results of study 1 showed a slight reduction of the ERN and OCD symptoms after the three-week executive control training thus strengthening its potential as a target for augmentative interventions. Study 2 focused on the potential contributions of psychophysiological markers for the diagnostic classification of problematic internet use (PIU). As PIU exhibits features of behavioral addiction but is also associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms its placement across the internalizing-externalizing spectrum is currently being discussed. Thus, psychophysiological markers of performance monitoring (ERN), reward processing (reward-related positivity, rewP), and inhibition (N2, P300) were assessed and results were compared to established patterns in addiction vs. internalizing disorders. Across all three tasks the results of study 2 rather favor the classification of PIU as an internalizing disorder. Taken together, the two studies illustrate the potential for application of the mechanistic insights derived from cross-sectional psychophysiological studies in additional areas of clinical research such as the development of novel interventions and diagnostic classification."}}, "2": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "11:00:00", "TalkEnd": "11:15:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Hannes Per Carsten", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

The majority of patients with OCD engage in repetitive checking, which might be a phenotypic expression of increased error monitoring. To test a causal link between checking behavior and the ERN, a preregistered, randomized-controlled design was employed. First, the baseline (T0) ERN of N = 90 university students was measured via electroencephalography during an Eriksen Flanker Task. Then, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: While an experimental group (n = 30) was instructed to repetitively check kitchen devices in a virtual reality (VR) environment, an active control group (n = 30) waited in the same VR environment, and a passive control group (n = 30) waited without a VR headset. Subsequently (T1), the ERN was assessed again. The checking induction resulted in an increased ERN after symptom induction (T1) in the experimental group compared with the active control group. This effect was specific to the ERN, as no differences in the correct-related negativity (CRN) emerged. Repetitive Checking in a virtual environment seems to impact the ERN, in line with previous cross-sectional studies. This finding implies that checking compulsions, which are highly prevalent among patients with OCD, might be a phenotypic expression of an increased ERN. Future studies could extend these findings to clinical samples with OCD."}}, "3": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "11:15:00", "TalkEnd": "11:30:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Mareike Bayer", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

In this simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, we investigate the role of personal relevance in emotional face processing in ASC. Participants with ASC and matched controls (N=46) performed an emotion recognition task including a personally relevant person and a matched stranger, displaying fearful, happy, and neutral facial expressions. Both groups showed significantly increased hemodynamic activity for relevant vs. stranger\u2019s faces in the core and extended face processing network, including fusiform gyrus, medial PFC and precuneus. Crucially, emotion effects in ASC were limited to relevant faces, while the control group showed emotion effects for both relevant and unknown faces. In EEG data, increased P1 amplitudes to relevant vs. stranger\u2019s faces were observed only for the non-autistic group, while later effects (P3) were present for both groups. In addition, cross-modal representational similarity analyses (RSA) analyses revealed that significant shared representations between EEG and fMRI data at sensory stages were again limited to the control group. Our results indicate that face processing in ASC seems to be characterised by a higher specificity, rather than a general dysfunction. Furthermore, EEG data revealed differences in the temporal profile of face processing, where modulations at sensory stages were limited to the control group. Our results speak to the importance of using individualized stimuli and multi-modal analyses in order to allow for the investigation of real-life social information processing in clinical populations."}}, "4": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "11:30:00", "TalkEnd": "11:45:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Julia Klawohn ", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an effective treatment for OCD, yet a significant number of patients do not sufficiently respond to intervention. In line with recent advances in individualized medicine approaches, neurocognitive biomarkers could help identify individuals at risk for non-response and provide insight into underlying mechanisms. Here, we examined whether the late positive potential (LPP), a neural correlate of emotional reactivity, could serve as a prospective predictor of therapy response in patients with OCD (n = 100). Results indicated gender-moderated prediction of therapy response by LPP to unpleasant and pleasant emotional pictures. That is, female patients with relatively higher reactivity to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli were more likely to benefit from CBT, possibly through lower emotional avoidance. Moreover, findings from the same sample suggest that higher resting heart-rate-variability (HRV) also is a predictor of greater symptom reduction through CBT, particularly in female patients with OCD. As HRV has been discussed as a marker of flexible implicit emotion regulation, these findings align to indicate that both biological measures of emotional responsivity can serve as clinical prognostic markers in OCD, with blunting in responsivity being predictive of higher risk for non-response to CBT. Implications of these findings with respect to the clinical utility of such markers and further directions will be discussed."}}}}, "session1-2": {"Index": "S02", "Talk": "Leveraging Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data in the Cognitive Neurosciences: Implementations, Insights, and Challenges", "Title": "S02 - Leveraging Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data in the Cognitive Neurosciences: Implementations, Insights, and Challenges", "Mantel": "Electrophysiological recordings have been instrumental in unraveling the brain's functional dynamics, offering insights into neural processes underlying perception, cognition, and behavior.

With these techniques, one can obtain two main types of neuronal dynamics: evoked responses and oscillations. As a general rule, evoked responses and oscillations are considered distinct types of activity. However, we suggest that a number of evoked responses and oscillations should not be regarded as different neuronal phenomena but rather can be viewed as one and the same process. Those oscillations that have an asymmetry in the amplitude and undergo modulation by the stimulus will unavoidably generate an evoked response. In a series of studies, we show that the most abundant rhythm in the human brain\u2014the alpha rhythm\u2014has an asymmetry in the amplitude and, when perturbed by the stimulus or internal event, indeed generates slow, long-lasting evoked responses. We demonstrate that this is the case for late visual evoked response, P300, and the readiness potential. In particular, at between- and within-participant levels, the extent of alpha amplitude modulation directly translates to a change in the amplitude of the evoked response. Therefore, we advocate for the analysis of oscillatory dynamics in order to be able to neurophysiologically interpret the changes in evoked responses. Additionally, establishing a mechanistic link between evoked responses and oscillations helps to build an integrated perspective on neuronal signals in the human brain."}}, "6": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-2", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "10:50:00", "TalkEnd": "11:10:00", "Room": "Room 1.12/1.13", "Talk": "Leveraging Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data in the Cognitive Neurosciences: Implementations, Insights, and Challenges", "Speaker": "Christopher Gundlach", "Chair": "Norman Forschack", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Norman Forschack, Christopher Gundlach, Alina Studenova, Martina Kopcanova, Christian Keitel, Niels A.

Attention, however, fluctuates, leading to varying behavioral responses over time. At the same time, it is assumed that attentional selection may be implemented by different neural mechanisms, as indicated by repeatedly found attentional changes of different and unrelated neural measures such as early sensory gain or visual and motor alpha-band activity. We here probed whether attention-modulated trial-by-trial fluctuations of these measures are predictive of behavioral responses. For this purpose, in an EEG experiment with a classical visuo-spatial attention task, arrows validly, invalidly, or neutrally cued a to be discriminated stimulus. Single-trial flicker-driven Steady-State-Visual-Evoked-Potentials (SSVEPs), visual and motor alpha-band activity were measured in a cue-target interval and their relationship with reaction times was modeled via Bayesian regression models. We found that these neural measures and behavioral responses were overall modulated by the attentional cue. Yet, while SSVEP amplitudes were not associated with behavior, single-trial alpha-band amplitudes were predictive of reaction times: For trials with a valid or neutral cue, lower amplitudes of visual and motor alpha-band activity contralateral to the target (and for valid cues also higher amplitudes ipsilateral to the target) were associated with faster responses. For invalid cues, however, which required re-allocating attention to the uncued side, no relationship was found.

Importantly, time-on-task effects explained variability in single-trial reaction times and both, alpha frequency, and power. Moreover, controlling for time-on-task effectively removed the relationship between alpha activity and reaction times.  However, time-on-task effects did not affect other EEG signatures of behavioural performance, including post-stimulus predictors of single-trial decision confidence.

The work discussed in the symposium will focus on the analysis of neural measures such as \u2018traditional\u2019 event-related potentials (ERPs), oscillatory activity, and \u2018new\u2019 measures like signal entropy as well as single-trial behavioral measures. By showcasing recent experiments, we will explore emerging technologies and computational tools that can aid in the analysis of single-trial data, such as spectral decomposition, denoising procedures, information theoretic measures, and Bayesian statistical modeling approaches. We present how these novel methodologies are implemented to explicitly probe and uncover general neural mechanisms underlying perception and cognitive functions. In a joint discussion, we will deepen our understanding of the advantages, limitations, conceptual assumptions, and prerequisites as well as the obstacles of analyzing single-trial data to advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of the brain and their relationship to human cognition and behavior.", "Uni": "University of L\u00fcbeck", "Abstract": {"title": "Leveraging trial-to-trial neural dynamics to understand human cognition;", "body": "When linking brain and behaviour, researchers typically rely on some average neural measure to suppress seemingly random trial-to-trial fluctuations also known as noise. For example, ERP analysis considers the mean EEG response over trials, while spectral analysis often considers the mean amplitude in a specific frequency range. Although the mean-based approach has proved useful, it is becoming clear that trial-to-trial fluctuations in neural activity are in fact also informative, representing beneficial variability that is typically strongly linked to behaviour. In particular, I will show that higher variability, as measured in entropy (a measure of signal unpredictability), is generally linked to greater cognitive flexibility and the ability to maintain stable task performance when conditions become more challenging. Notably, entropy continues to explain behaviour even when accounting for conventional EEG measures such as spectral power and ERPs, suggesting a unique contribution to the neural underpinnings of cognition. The inherently variable nature of brain activity could even begin to help understand why classification of cognitive states based on predictable, repeating patterns in neural data, as is typically done in machine learning, is generally not very accurate. Together, our results suggest that trial-to-trial neural variability is crucial for the remarkable ability of humans to cognitively adapt to an ever-changing environment."}}}}, "session1-3": {"Index": "S03", "Talk": "Cognitive Brain States from a Network Neuroscience Perspective ", "Title": "S03 - Cognitive Brain States from a Network Neuroscience Perspective ", "Mantel": "Brain states are recurring patterns of distributed brain activity.

Both network architectures can be analyzed harnessing tools from network neuroscience, including topological and state-space markers, that provide a common descriptive framework to gain insight into abstract mechanisms of computational processes. Here, we report first results from a pilot study with six participants that undergo intensive longitudinal smartphone-based cognitive testing using a task battery consisting of 12 tasks.

Cognitive performance data from each participant and task was used to train recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Resulting network structure and activity was examined using topological markers (brain network integration, segregation) and dynamical system properties (task variance). Our results show that RNNs can learn to perform a broad range of cognitive tasks with similar accuracy than humans (> 90%). In contrast to humans, tasks with a more complex input structure require more training to reach performance peaks.

Our neuroimaging method investigated changes over time in two complementing indicators of structural und functional brain network organization: myelin-sensitive T1 relaxometry and cortical functional gradients. Significant alterations in microstructure and intrinsic brain function were noted, and these differences varied according to the social training undertaken. Specifically, attention-mindfulness and socio-cognitive training altered microstructure and intrinsic function in areas functionally linked to attention and interoception, such as the parietal and insular cortices. In contrast, although there was no functional reorganization, socio-affective and socio-cognitive training produced distinct microstructural alterations in areas that are traditionally linked to interoceptive and emotional processing, such as the insular and orbitofrontal areas. Moreover, behavioral improvements in perspective-taking, compassion, and attentiveness were predicted by long-term changes in these structural und functional brain network organization. Notably, though we observed marked microstructural re-organization over the 9-month period of training, functional changes showed more dynamic alterations, suggesting more state-like influences of training on intrinsic function.

Here, we apply multivariate analyses to human MEG data to study the overlap between veridical and false perception across two discrete stages of perceptual inference: discrimination of content (what did I see) and detection (did I see something?). To this end, participants performed a visual discrimination task requiring them to indicate the orientation of a noisy grating, as well as their confidence in having seen a grating. Importantly, on 50% of trials no gratings were presented (noise-only trials). On a subset of these noise-only trials, participants reported seeing a grating with high confidence, dubbed here false percepts. We found that a sensory signal reflecting the content of these false percepts was present both before and after stimulus onset.

Furthermore, the magnitude of the N15 source field varies based on the subject's state (resting vs. active motor state) and TMS dose affects both magnitude and location. While the N15 source strongly correlates with TMS-generated motor evoked potentials, our results underscore that N15 primarily reflects cortical excitability rather than corticospinal excitability, emphasising its suitability to investigate the central nervous system.

In this study of adults with remitted depression (rMDD), using two computational modeling approaches, we probed underlying decision-making processes to assess overall willingness to expend effort in rMDD and characterize latent decision strategies dependent on reward magnitude and probability. 108 participants, 40 unmedicated rMDD and 68 healthy controls, completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). In each trial, participants chose to complete an easy or a hard task as a function of reward magnitude and probability. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed that rMDDs demonstrated generally reduced willingness to expend effort, particularly for lower levels of reward magnitude and probability which reverted when reward was high and more likely. Similarly, Hierarchical Bayesian Drift Diffusion Modeling (HDDM) demonstrated a reduced tendency to accumulate evidence towards the high effort option but increased impact on drift-rate with high reward magnitude and probability in rMDD. Notably, subjective value modeling showed no group differences in decision-making strategies incorporating reward magnitude and probability information. Consistent with prior research, our findings suggest a persistent blunted reward sensitivity in rMDD.

First, in 59 patients with MDD and healthy control participants (HCPs), we replicate the previously reported invigorating effects of taVNS during the first session and reveal its generalizability to depression. Crucially, invigoration remained elevated in all participants, and patients with MDD showed persistent increases in wanting after taVNS in Session 1. Second, in 96 patients with MDD and HCPs, we show that symptoms of apathy and anhedonia, rather than depression itself, are linked to lower effort exertion and wanting, respectively. Higher fasting levels of ghrelin were associated with greater wanting, but this correspondence was attenuated by anhedonia. Third, HCPs (current N=18) received infusions of ghrelin, or saline during an instrumental motivation task using a double-blind crossover study during [11C] PET-fMRI. After ghrelin administration, participants\u2019 willingness to work for food versus monetary rewards increased, resulting in greater caloric payoff indicative of a shift in reward preference.

An alternative approach is to perform a mass univariate analysis along with cluster-based permutation testing. This approach is particularly helpful when there is little a priori knowledge about where and when the differences between conditions will be at their maximum. Here, we illustrate the advantages and pitfalls of this data-driven approach with two examples. First, event-related potential analysis is used to investigate an auditory discrimination task in which the topography of the effect size was not known a priori. Second, time-frequency analysis is used to detect electrophysiological indicators of the latent construct flexibility for the investigation of intraindividual differences. The potential of the mass univariate analysis approach for exploratory and hypothesis-driven research is discussed, while also looking at difficulties such as defining clusters and separating overlapping clusters, dealing with very large clusters that span many electrodes, frequencies, and time points, integrating results from ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests, or deciding on the appropriate permutation approach.

In the face of increasingly large datasets and the quest for greater replicability, ERP latency extraction should prove reliable, valid, efficient, and objective. Automated algorithms for extracting peak or area latencies often encounter problems with low reliability or validity, which is a major challenge especially when investigating individual differences. In this talk, Sven Lesche introduces a novel algorithm for ERP latency extraction based on template matching. The algorithm uses the grand average to generate a data-driven template of the component of interest and then matches that template to subject-level ERPs to recover the latency of the component in a given signal. In addition to a latency estimate, the algorithm provides a fit statistic for each subject-level ERP, indicating the degree of certainty the algorithm has in its decision. Preliminary results suggest that the template matching algorithm is able to recover simulated shifts in latency better than peak or area latency algorithms. Benefits and drawbacks of the fit statistic the algorithm provides will be compared to previous efforts to quantify uncertainty in measurement, such as the SME (Luck et al., 2021).

Similarly, theta oscillations emerged in RNNs after training, and model units showed similar phase-dependent activity related to item position as recorded neurons. However, in contrast to the theory, the ordering of preferred phase of firing did not reflect the serial order of encoded memory items, both for recorded and model units. Instead, our modeling linked temporal order to stimulus timing and oscillation frequency, which we subsequently confirmed in our neural recordings.

How cognitive control regulates WM storage, however, remains unknown. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while epilepsy patients maintained multiple items in WM. In the hippocampus, theta-gamma PAC was indicative of WM load and correlated with behavior. We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity representations of WM content that were associated with improved behavior. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of WM, with frontal control managing maintenance of WM content in storage-related areas. Within this framework, hippocampal theta-gamma PAC integrates cognitive control and WM storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes."}}, "35": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 2-3", "SessionStart": "13:00:00", "SessionEnd": "14:30:00", "TalkStart": "14:00:00", "TalkEnd": "14:20:00", "Room": "Small auditorium", "Talk": "Unraveling cognitive and executive functions using human single-neuron recordings", "Speaker": "Alessandro Gulberti", "Chair": "Jonathan Daume, Stefanie Liebe", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Jonathan Daume, Stefanie Liebe, Co-Autoren: Doris Dijksterhuis, Alessandro Gulberti\n\nSingle-neuron recordings provide unparalleled insights into neural mechanisms underlying human behavior at cellular resolution.

Spontaneous fluctuations in the power of this rhythm are associated with the modulation of neuronal excitability and corresponding changes in perceptual decision-making. Shifts in its hemispheric distribution can be induced by instructional cues requiring selective attention or memorization of task-relevant information, or the selective inhibition of task-irrelevant or distracting information. While this effect is highly robust, recent studies have questioned whether alpha lateralization plays a causal role in distractor inhibition or is merely a by-product of other cue-related effects. In a first study, we investigated the role of alpha lateralization by leveraging the inhibition of return phenomenon, where attention is oriented away from an exogenously cued location. Interestingly, alpha lateralization reflected only attentional capture at the cued location but not the long-lasting attentional reorienting towards non-cued locations. Moreover, alpha lateralization was strongly correlated with the pattern of microsaccades. In our second study, we examined lateralization in a visual short-term memory task, in which participants made a lateral saccade during the memory delay interval to test in which spatial reference frame lateralization codes spatial information. We found that after the saccade, contralateral delay activity reflected memory representations coded in retinotopic coordinates, whereas alpha lateralization reflected a memory-unspecific screen center bias that was highly correlated with small shifts in gaze direction. Overall, these studies confirmed the link between alpha lateralization and cueing but also showed that the direction of lateralization can be decoupled from attentional orienting and memorization."}}, "38": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 2-4", "SessionStart": "13:00:00", "SessionEnd": "14:30:00", "TalkStart": "13:30:00", "TalkEnd": "13:45:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "The focused mind: neural signatures of selective attention in perception and memory", "Speaker": "Philipp Deutsch", "Chair": "Melinda Sabo, Daniel Schneider ", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Niko Busch, Philipp Deutsch, Melinda Sabo, Daniel Schneider, Sarah Tune, \n\nSelective attention plays a crucial role in shaping both perception and memory.

We asked participants to memorize the pitch of a target sound and to compare it with a probe sound presented after a 13-s memory delay period. In separate conditions, we compared a blank delay phase (no distraction) with either passive listening to, or active processing of, an auditory distractor presented throughout the memory delay. Consistent with previous reports, pitch-specific memory information could be decoded from fMRI signal patterns in auditory cortex during the delay in trials without distraction. In contrast, decoding of target sounds in auditory cortex dropped to chance level during both unattended and attended distraction. This was paralleled by memory performance decrements under distraction.

This was done using a visual working memory task that was randomly interrupted by an arithmetic task. After the interruption or no-interruption phase, a retro-cue indicated which of two stimulus orientations had to be reported. In no-interruption trials, the delay before retro-cue presentation was either short (2300ms) or long (3300ms). The interruption task had to be completed within 1800ms and was followed by either a short (500ms), long (1500ms) or self-paced (indicated by key press) resumption phase. While primary task accuracy (i.e., the precision of the orientation report) was reduced by a preceding interruption, it was not modulated by the time available in the resumption phase. However, primary task response times benefited from longer resumption phases, especially when the length of the resumption interval was self-paced. At the EEG level, theta oscillatory power (4-7Hz) at frontal sites and the suppression of posterior alpha power (8-14Hz) were used as correlates of attentional control processes after retro-cue presentation. Both theta power and alpha power suppression were reduced after an interruption, but the suppression of alpha power was also stronger with longer resumption phases.

We paralleled these to scalp recordings of healthy controls.

We hypothesised that high load reduces emotion effects during face processing and angry faces disrupt WM-processes by occupying shared cognitive resources. There were significant effects of load and emotion, but no simultaneous interaction in the source-space analyses. Spatiotemporal clusters starting 190 ms after face-onset revealed that angry faces elicited stronger activation in prefrontal and face-specific occipital areas, the insula, and anterior cingulate cortex during emotion discrimination. Insula activation was further correlated with later occipital reactivation, suggesting enhanced salience and processing for angry faces. When angry and happy faces were compared, a prefrontal cluster emerged 400 ms after face-onset, probably reflecting goal-directed control mechanisms required for angry faces. In gaze-related and behavioural analyses, we observed a positivity bias with processing advantages for positive faces. In the high-load n-back, alpha and beta power was reduced in parieto- and temporo-occipital regions and cingulate cortex, indicating reduced distractor inhibition and WM-processes. In conclusion, our findings suggest different processing modes and required resources, when discriminating angry faces and performing a high-load n-back. However, the resource toll did not have a sustainable impact on the functional brain networks and performance of the upcoming task."}}, "43": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 2-5", "SessionStart": "13:00:00", "SessionEnd": "14:30:00", "TalkStart": "13:30:00", "TalkEnd": "13:45:00", "Room": "Room 0.12/0.13", "Talk": "Towards the Study of Interacting Emotional and Cognitive Processes and Their Neurophysiological Basis", "Speaker": "Anya Dietrich", "Chair": "Katharina Lingelbach", "Inhalt": "Autor Katharina Lingelbach, Co-Autoren: Enya Weidner, Anya Dietrich, Christoph Scheffel, Maren Bertheau\n\nIn the past, cognitive and emotional processes were often investigated separately, ignoring their interdependence in human nature.

Regulatory effort is integral to various stages: from the selection of ER strategies, through their implementation, to the post-regulation effects. During the selection phase, individuals display a preference for strategies that entail lower cognitive demands, striking a balance between efficacy and expended effort. In our three studies, we found that 45% to 63% percentage of participants chose to reapply the strategy that was less effortful. Empirical evidence in the implementation phase underscores the necessity of cognitive effort in ER, as indicated by subjective reports and physiological markers. In our studies we found that suppression was associated with lower effort (Study 1: p= .042, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .04; Study 2: p = .002, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .13; Study 3: p < .001, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .52).

In the case of an unavoidable traffic accident, participants consistently favored sparing pedestrians over passengers, more characters over fewer characters, and humans over pets. In the EEG we did not observe the anticipated distinct error potentials, specifically feedback related negativity but a fronto-central late positive potential (LPP, 458 to 928 ms) when the putative AI's decision contradicted the participants\u2019 decision.

Supporting this premise, a highly cited work by Parise and Spence (2009, *n* = 12) reported worse discrimination of temporal order for audiovisual stimuli with congruent compared to incongruent sound\u2013shape associations. This influential study is situated at the 98.6th percentile of all articles published in 2009 and curated by the *Web of Science*, across all disciplines, and has been cited more than 300 times according to *Google Scholar*.

To test the stability of incentivized prosocial decisions, we conducted two online experiments (65 and 36 participants) and one fMRI experiment (55 participants; all preregistered https://osf.io/4uvqj/registrations,). In a first block (acquisition) of a social decision game, prosocial decisions were incentivized (80% probability of 20 cents reward for decisions in favor of the other person) and in the second block (extinction), these incentives stopped. Results showed that participants\u2019 prosocial decisions increased during acquisition and declined during extinction. This decline was significantly less pronounced when people interacted with another person than when they interacted with a computer. Testing potential mechanisms, reinforcement learning drift-diffusion modelling (RLDDM) showed that when interacting with another person, prosocial decisions were more efficient (larger drift-rate parameter) and characterized by more reactive learning (larger learning rate) in the acquisition block than in the extinction block. When interacting with a computer, drift rates were also larger during acquisition than extinction but learning rates did not differ between blocks.

However, it remains unclear how letters are represented in the brain, and how to capture and describe this representational space. Theoretically informed approaches to the representation of letter orthography have previously focused on measures of overlap between representations of letters. More recent approaches infer similarities from deep learning models trained to recognise letters and words. Here, we adopted a novel approach, applying optimal transport: a well-established framework, commonly applied in areas such as statistics, physics, and economics, that deals with problems analogous to the efficient transportation of mass. We apply optimal transport to describe letter similarities as the degree of work required to transform one letter into another, in a manner that captures global shape and spatial relationships. In a preregistered EEG study (*N* = 15, based on simulations) using representational similarity analysis, we show that optimal transport distance can explain the representational similarity of letters in periods associated with visual and orthographic processing. We show that optimal transport outperforms descriptions that capture simple overlap (BF > 1000), and that it has similar predictive power to deep learning models. We argue that the optimal transport framework can provide elegant and powerful descriptions of visual-orthographic similarity which align with neural representations of letters. It is far less computationally expensive than deep learning models, requires no training, and can provide computationally explicit results that are directly interpretable, supporting a more theory-driven investigation into visual and orthographic representations."}}, "51": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 3-1", "SessionStart": "14:45:00", "SessionEnd": "16:15:00", "TalkStart": "15:30:00", "TalkEnd": "15:39:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Posterblitz", "Speaker": "Kim M.

Previous research has shown that sending a facial emotional expression influences the evaluation of response expressions, but it remains unclear whether this effect is driven by the display of the facial expression or rather by the communicative intention. In a preregistered experiment, 68 participants were asked to send an emoji (smiley, neutral, frowny) via a computer display to a virtual agent in front of them, whereupon the agent reacted with either a smiling or frowning facial expression. Mimicry responses were measured via facial EMG of the Zygomaticus and Corrugator muscle following the agent\u2019s response. In addition, valence and arousal ratings were obtained after the interactive exchange. The results show that being smiled at is more pleasant and elicits greater Zygomaticus activation when the smile is received as a response to a smile emoji compared to a neutral or frown emoji. Interestingly, a mirrored pattern but with a smaller effect size was observed when participants were being frowned at, i.e. an agent\u2019s frown was less pleasant and elicited greater Corrugator activation when it followed a smile emoji compared to a frown emoji. The results demonstrate that communicative intentions are sufficient to change the evaluation of facial response expressions of an interactive partner and that persons are sensitive to the congruency in emotional signals between sender and receiver.

In contrast, in hippocampal CA1 networks, only cells active during cortical sleep spindles exhibit a sustained reduction in calcium activity across cycles of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.

Recent evidence has shown that ripples are not confined to the hippocampus, but rather constitute a widespread neocortical phenomenon. To date, it remains unclear whether hippocampal and neocortical ripples are morphologically similar. Crucially, the functional role of neocortical ripples remains undetermined. In this study, we conducted intracranial recordings in patients with epilepsy from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortex during sleep. Results indicate a consistent ripple morphology across regions, and reveal region-specific functional specializations. MTL ripples facilitate directional information flow from the MTL to neocortex, thus promoting synchronization of the memory network. Conversely, neocortical ripples impede this information flow, potentially minimizing interference with local processing. At the population level, MTL ripples restrict population dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace, whereas neocortical ripples lead to more diverse and higher-dimensional population responses. This differentiation may constitute the mechanism that functionally uncouples the MTL-neocortical network. Importantly, the key findings were replicated in rodents, wherein the same division-of-labor between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was observed.

Critically, although SWRs are precisely coupled to the cardinal NREM sleep-related mesoscopic brain rhythms (i.e., cortical slow oscillations and thalamocortical spindles), evidence for a link between SWRs and directed information transfer is scarce. Here, we leveraged the rare opportunity of nocturnal single-unit and LFP recordings in neurosurgical patients to uncover the SWR-triggered information flow by tracking the impact of SWRs on single-neuron activity along the hippocampal output network, including entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex. We recorded 1433 neurons during 40 night sessions in 17 epilepsy patients implanted with hybrid macro-micro electrodes for presurgical diagnostics. Preliminary results indicate a consistent pattern of temporally precise increases in neuronal firing rate (FR) synchronized with hippocampal SWRs. Importantly, FR increases were not confined to local hippocampal neurons but also became apparent in single neurons in distant, downstream regions, suggesting an interregional impact of SWRs. The temporal delay along the hippocampal-neocortical pathway suggests a causal directionality, with the hippocampus as the driving hub. Our results support the idea of a causal relationship between SWRs and hippocampal-neocortical information transmission during sleep. SWRs appear to trigger a cascade of temporally precise, interregional synchronized co-firing, facilitating synaptic modifications and thus underpinning their essential mechanistic role within systems consolidation."}}}}, "session3-3": {"Index": "S13", "Talk": "Uncovering lifespan signatures: A multimodal perspective at the interface of development, aging, and disease risk ", "Title": "S13 - Uncovering lifespan signatures: A multimodal perspective at the interface of development, aging, and disease risk ", "Mantel": "The emergence of various disorders often coincides with specific age windows, indicating alterations in developmental or aging pathways.

Healthy aging is characterized by heterogenous levels of structural changes that influence oscillatory and neural dynamics. In this symposium, I will first talk about whether different measures of brain signal variability \u2013 identified with hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiological (EEG) methods \u2013 reflect the same underlying physiology in healthy younger (N=135) and older adults (N=54). While we observed age-related differences in brain signal variability obtained with rs-fMRI and rs-EEG, surprisingly, the two measures showed no significant correlation; instead, they seemed to provide complementary information on the state of the aging brain. Following this, I will discuss about the mechanism by which brain structure (e.g., white matter hyperintensity) may influence age-dependent oscillatory changes (e.g., alpha peak frequency) assessed by EEG (N=907).

Here, we introduce an exploratory analysis using an innovative event-related approach. In the nationwide research network for exposure therapy (PROTECT-AD), n = 267 patients with diverse anxiety disorders and n = 84 healthy controls were investigated during a two-day differential fear extinction paradigm. Fear conditioned and extinguished responses were measured per trial through threat expectancy ratings, fear-potentiated startle, and skin conductance response. We identified trials per subject that indicated important hallmarks of threat expectancy change for the conditioned cue (CS+) during extinction training (e.g., trial with rating of zero, individual lowest value or maximum relative change) and analysed the multi-modal responses before and after those 'events'. Preliminary analyses revealed a steeper decline in threat expectancy directly preceding the events and a greater rebound afterwards for patients, compared to controls. Additionally, patients showed an increase of the startle response during the event trial, suggesting differences in the timing of the subcortical defensive response activation in comparison with controls.

To date, 15 participants underwent a three-day, within-subject, category-based fear conditioning paradigm. Two conditioned stimulus (CS) categories were paired with an electric shock during acquisition training (CSa+; CSb+), while one CS category was not (CS-). On day two, extinction training was followed by a prompt to retrieve the inhibitory learning association and to imagine the same experience with novel stimuli for the CSa+ category. On day three, participants were tested for extinction generalization, including elements seen during acquisition and extinction training, as well as new or the vividly imagined elements. Preliminary data indicate reduced return of fear for stimuli imagined during extinction memory updating compared to novel stimuli of the same (CSa+) or other categories (CSb+), as evidenced by reduced skin conductance response and fear-potentiated startle.

Formalized as defense cascade model, it was shown that an approaching inevitable threat (e.g., electric shock) elicits a state of parasympathetically-dominated attentive immobility, marked by increasing cardiac deceleration and skin conductance (post-encounter defense). However, if the threat is most imminent and can be actively avoided (circa-strike), the organism is under growing sympathetic control, indicated by cardiac acceleration and even more increased skin conductance. Here, we tested whether similar dynamics of autonomic defensive responding are also observed in the context of social threat. Forty-one healthy participants underwent a novel social defense cascade paradigm, in which increasing social threat imminence was operationalized by pictures of neutral faces, that gradually changed to full-blown angry expressions accompanied by auditory negative devaluations. In half of the trials participants had the option to actively avoid the auditory social threat, while in the other half social threat was inevitable. In line with prior research using electric shocks, we found that cardiac deceleration defined the defensive response pattern when participants were exposed to approaching inevitable social threat, switching to acceleration when threat was avoidable and most imminent. Contrasting previous research, however, we found that skin conductance decreased when approaching social threat was inevitable and only increased when participants had the option to avoid. These results suggest that dynamic defensive responding to approaching threat can generally be translated to the social domain, however also point to specific response patterns."}}, "69": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 3-4", "SessionStart": "14:45:00", "SessionEnd": "16:15:00", "TalkStart": "15:45:00", "TalkEnd": "16:00:00", "Room": "Small auditorium", "Talk": "Exploring emotional dynamics: Physiological and subjective insights from clinical and experimental perspectives\u00a0", "Speaker": "Yunbo Yang ", "Chair": " Janine Wirkner, Maike Hollandt", "Inhalt": "Autor Janine Wirkner, Co-Autor: Maike Hollandt\n\nIn this symposium, we explore research on threat reactivity, fear extinction, and emotion regulation, providing valuable insights from both clinical and experimental perspectives to enhance our understanding of the complex biopsychosocial factors associated with mental disorders.\nThe first contribution investigates threat reactivity in patients with primary anxiety or depressive disorders within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.

Critically, there were several subtle changes in the contrast and the orientation of the distractor, and participants were cued to either ignore the distractor, detect a change in contrast, or detect a change in orientation. Despite sensory stimulation being matched in all three conditions, the fidelity of memory representations in early visual cortex was highest when the distractor was ignored, intermediate when participants attended distractor contrast, and lowest when participants attended the orientation of the distractor during the delay. In contrast, the fidelity of distractor representations was lowest when ignoring the distractor, intermediate when attending distractor-contrast, and highest when attending distractor-orientation.

This can be used strategically when searching for an object; visual input that resembles the content of working memory is favored by the visual system over visual input that does not. Memory-driven search requires visual processing regions to actively maintain a visual representation of the target object, while simultaneously processing novel visual input (i.e., the scene). But how should the object be represented? Visual objects produce very different retinal images depending on where they are in the scene. The color of the retinal image, for instance, depends on the illumination, and its size can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the viewing distance. Accordingly, the current visual input (i.e., the search location) might also determine the nature of the memory representation, because \u2013 in order to benefit search \u2013 memory representations need to account for contextual dependencies. Here, we measured fMRI BOLD activity in human observers while they prepared to search for objects at different distances in indoor scene photographs. First, we established that observers instantiated visual memory representations of the target object in object-selective cortex during search preparation (while no object was presented). Second, we demonstrated that these visual object representations were scaled to account for viewing distance: activity patterns reflected smaller object representations during distant search, and larger object representations during nearby search.

In this study, we investigated whether and how side effects can trigger positive treatment expectations and enhance treatment outcomes. 77 healthy participants were led to believe that they would receive pain relief nasal sprays before undergoing thermal pain stimuli. However, these nasal sprays actually contained either capsaicin to induce a mild burning sensation or saline. After initial testing, participants were then randomized into two groups, one continuing to believe the nasal sprays contained pain relief medication while the other was informed otherwise, allowing for independent manipulation of side effects and pain relief expectations. Findings reveal that nasal sprays with side effects result in lower perceived pain compared to inert sprays without side effects. The influence of side effects on pain perception depends upon individual beliefs about the relationship of side effects and treatment effectiveness and upon expectations regarding treatment received. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data implicate the involvement of the descending pain modulatory system, including the anterior cingulate cortex and the periaqueductal gray, in mediating the effects of side effects on pain perception. Overall, these results indicate that mild side effects can signal effective treatment, thereby influencing treatment expectations and outcomes through the descending pain modulatory system.

Negative expectations, i.e. nocebo effects, have rarely been studied in visceral pain. Considering visceral pain being more salient and more anxiety-evoking than somatic pain, the elucidation of nocebo effects in visceral pain in the laboratory is necessary to increase knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated the differences of somatic and visceral pain in a nocebo paradigm and from a translational perspective by modeling the experience of fluctuating pain of different modalities as commonly experienced by patients. The experimental design included the factors \"treatment instruction\" (negative vs. neutral), induced by aspects of doctor-patient communication, and \"treatment experience\" (negative vs. neutral), induced by a negative experience with covertly increased thermal pain, randomizing healthy volunteers (N=102) into four groups. Our results, which will be presented, show distinct differences between visceral and somatic pain in terms of treatment expectations. Indeed, our data indicate it requires a combination of negative instruction and experience for the somatic modality to be perceived as equally unpleasant as visceral pain, emphasizing the inherent threat of visceral pain, potentially, relevant to the maintenance or transition from acute to chronic pain.

Heat pain stimuli were administered at individually calibrated fixed intensities in each trial. The expectation manipulation proved effective, with participants reporting higher expected and perceived pain in the negative expectation condition compared to the positive condition, and also showing higher SCRs. On the neural level, we observed a general temporal succession from common neural representations of positive and negative expectations during the anticipation phase towards distinct representations based on their valence during noxious stimulation in the DLPFC, vmPFC, anterior insula, and angular gyrus. MR-informed EEG analysis indicated a temporal sequence of common effects during the anticipation phase starting with the DLPFC, going on to the anterior insula, and concluding with the ACC near pain onset. In conclusion, expectations and pain perception could be reliably manipulated using a sham-BCI. The representations of positive and negative expectations largely overlapped during pain anticipation and differentiated during pain processing, with multiple expectation-related processes occurring over time.

In our current study, we aim to explore neurobehavioral expectation effects in late life. Fifty-five healthy older adults, characterized in their cognitive control ability, participate in two experimental days (cross-over design).

After nasal spray application, fMRI signals are measured while participants perform a modified spatial cueing paradigm that manipulates attentional resources to process emotional face distractors. Expectation, mood state and experience ratings are assessed throughout the experiment. We hypothesize that positive expectation induction increases a positivity bias (i.e., stronger distraction by happy faces) in older adults, especially when more attentional resources are available to process faces and in participants with higher general control ability.

However, neural degeneration per se is not matched by unremitting declines in cognitive abilities. Instead, middle-aged and older adults typically maintain surprisingly high levels of cognitive functioning, suggesting that the human brain can adapt to structural degeneration by neural compensation. In this talk, I will summarize prevailing theories and recent empirical studies on neural compensation with a focus on often neglected contributing factors, such as lifestyle, metabolism, and neural plasticity. Research suggests that these factors moderate the relationship between structural integrity and neural compensation, maintaining psychological well-being and behavioural functioning. Possibly, a breakdown in neural compensation may pose a tipping point that distinguishes the trajectories of healthy vs. pathological ageing, but conjoint support from psychology and cognitive neuroscience for this alluring view is still scarce. Therefore, future experiments that target the concomitant processes of neural compensation and associated behaviour will foster a comprehensive understanding of both healthy and pathological ageing."}}, "81": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-1", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:15:00", "TalkEnd": "09:30:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Multidisciplinary and multimodal perspectives on episodic memory in neuropsychiatric disorders", "Speaker": "Thomas P.

Flexible retrieval can be operationalized by transitive inference paradigms, which require participants to infer hierarchical relationships between novel combinations of elements (e.g., B>D) based on knowledge formed in distinct learning episodes involving these elements in different contexts (e.g. A>B, B>C, C>D). A hypothesized mechanism enabling transitive inference is the widening of tuning of individual hippocampal neurons from responding to one element (B) prior to learning to responding to further, related elements (B and D) after learning. A rare opportunity to obtain decisive data on this hypothesis is given in chronic intracranial seizure monitoring in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with the primary aim to detect seizure onset zones for later surgical removal. Using data from 18 such patients while they performed a transitive inference task, we find evidence against persistent widening of tuning curves of individual neurons that initially responded to only one of the elements in the task. Unexpectedly, we find a group of neurons that did not respond to any stimuli involved in the task prior to learning but start responding specifically to combinations of elements (A>B; but not B> C) after learning. These neurons are found only in patients successfully performing transitive inference. These preliminary findings suggest a potentially novel single neuron mechanism enabling flexible expression of episodic memory in the case of transitive interference."}}, "82": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-1", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:30:00", "TalkEnd": "09:45:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Multidisciplinary and multimodal perspectives on episodic memory in neuropsychiatric disorders", "Speaker": "Angelica Staniloiu", "Chair": "Jessica Peter, Michael Orth ", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Jessica Peter, Michael Orth \n\nThe ability to form and retrieve memories about personal experiences is paramount for human existence.

Both static and functional brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography [PET], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) was performed, when available.

Glucose-PET evidenced hypometabolism in right frontotemporal brain regions. An abrupt loss of both memory for past experiences and personal identity is highly indicative of dissociative amnesia; anterograde or retrograde circumscribed dissociative amnesias can also occur. PET studies in retrograde dissociative amnesias point to hypometabolism in right frontotemporal regions that are centrally engaged in retrieving old episodic-autobiographical material.

Here, we utilized the trauma film paradigm along with pattern similarity analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to explore how trauma-analogue experiences are represented in the brain and how these representations are reactivated during memory intrusions. Participants viewed film clips depicting traumatic content as well as content-matched neutral scenes while undergoing fMRI scans. Subsequently, they reported instances of involuntary memory intrusions during a period of rest. Encoding of trauma-analog experiences was associated with higher activity in wide-spread visual areas and salience network but lower activation in superior temporal cortex compared to neutral events. Enhanced neural processing in visual areas, but not in superior temporal cortex, predicted the number of memory intrusions across participants. Using pattern similarity analyses, we observed that neural representations of trauma-analog experiences were more similar in visual areas, while trauma-analog representations in superior temporal cortex were more distinct compared to neural representations of neutral events. Prior to memory intrusions, pattern similarity in visual areas again increased between different memory intrusions suggesting trauma-unspecific visual representations. At the same time, memory intrusions reactivated specific neural representations of that same episode in anterior cingulate cortex. Our results suggest simultaneous involvement of multiple representational formats with different characteristics of specificity and similarity in visual areas and the anterior cingulate cortex during memory intrusions. Linking these characteristics to trauma memory phenomena, e.g., cue generalization, in the future may help unravel the neural pathway of memory intrusions."}}, "84": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-1", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "10:00:00", "TalkEnd": "10:15:00", "Room": "Large auditorium", "Talk": "Multidisciplinary and multimodal perspectives on episodic memory in neuropsychiatric disorders", "Speaker": "Michael Orth", "Chair": "Jessica Peter, Michael Orth ", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Jessica Peter, Michael Orth \n\nThe ability to form and retrieve memories about personal experiences is paramount for human existence.

Five minutes after encoding, a surprising free recall of the words followed. In both groups, modulation of the left DLPFC enhanced overall recall (p=.042). Recall of positive content increased as total number of positive words (p<.001) and in relation to overall recall (10-15%; p<.001). Assessing the first word recalled, in the sham condition, depressed participants recalled more than twice as often a negative than a positive word with an evenly balanced recall in controls.

Prior research suggests these levels of representation mutually inform one another, such that phonetic features are encoded until lexical identity is resolved (Gwilliams et al., 2022). The same work also revealed that the word-initial phoneme\u2019s features are pre-activated, suggesting that lexical prediction manifests in first phoneme pre-activation. Here, we investigate whether this flexibility in phonetic encoding is impaired in people with aphasia, and whether it explains their language deficit. We recorded EEG data during natural story listening in 24 healthy participants and 39 participants with aphasia. We applied time-resolved decoding of phonetic features from the EEG signals and found a significant group difference: phonetic features were decodable significantly longer in the control than in the aphasia group. Next, we will decode phonetic features as a function of low and high lexical entropy, i.e., a measure of uncertainty about word identity given the current phonemic input. We hypothesize that people with aphasia show a weaker relation between phoneme decoding time and lexical uncertainty compared to controls, indicating a weaker connection between these levels of representation. Finally, we will decode phonetic features for each phoneme position within a word separately. We hypothesize that people with aphasia will show less pre-activation of the first phoneme\u2018s features as a result of lexical prediction than controls.

Our results revealed that higher cognitive demands diminished the positive effects of word predictability on reading speed, suggesting that the formation of surprisal draws on resources of cognitive control.

These syntactic features were then mapped onto MEG source activity using multivariate temporal response functions (TRFs), which are linear kernels that describe how the brain responds to a representation of a (linguistic) feature. By including lower-level features as predictors in our TRF models, we explicitly modeled the acoustic (i.e., acoustic spectrogram, acoustic onsets) and statistical (i.e., word frequency, entropy, surprisal) properties of the stimuli. The results show that both syntactic features explain unique variance in the left-hemispheric language network, and that both have a distinct temporal response function. The effects were strongest for the predictive feature, showing that, during naturalistic comprehension, syntactic structures can be built in a predictive manner. Moreover, the combination of strong predictive effects and weak integratory effects suggests that successful predictive processing reduces demands on integratory processing. These results provide a dynamic view on the flexible adjustment of predictive and integratory syntactic structure building."}}}}, "session4-3": {"Index": "S19", "Talk": "The versatile role of the endocannabinoid system in clinical research", "Title": "S19 - The versatile role of the endocannabinoid system in clinical research", "Mantel": "Recent years have seen an emergent interest in research of the endocannabinoid system (ECS).

Bariatric surgery is one treatment option to induce large weight loss, which is associated with improvements in overall somatic health. However, it is not well-understood yet if and how subjective feelings of loneliness and enjoyment of being with others change after weight loss.

This would provide a mechanistic perspective on patients\u2019 daily life experiences. The current non-randomized clinical trial will recruit at least 113 individuals undergoing different types of bariatric surgery.

A new perspective on the predictive potential of deviations from structured auditory regularities.", "body": "The auditory system has an amazing ability to rapidly encode auditory regularities. Evidence comes from the popular oddball paradigm, in which frequent (standard) sounds are occasionally exchanged for rare (deviant) sounds, which then elicit signs of prediction error based on their unexpectedness (e.g., MMN, P3a, decline in performance). Here, we examine the widely neglected characteristics of deviants being bearers of predictive information themselves. Naive participants listened to sound sequences constructed according to a new, modified version of the oddball paradigm including two types of deviants that followed diametrically opposed rules: one deviant sound occurred mostly in pairs (repetition rule), the other deviant sound occurred mostly in isolation (non-repetition rule). Due to this manipulation, the sound following a first deviant (either the same deviant or a standard) was either predictable or unpredictable based on its conditional probability associated with the preceding deviant sound. The response times and false alarm rates in an active deviant detection task show that deviant repetition rules (based on conditional probability) can be extracted when behaviourally relevant. The electrophysiological findings obtained in a passive listening setting indicate that conditional probability also translates into differential processing at the P3a level. However, MMN was confined to global deviants and was not sensitive to conditional probability. This suggests that higher-level processing (reflected in P3a and behaviour) but not lower-level sensory processing (reflected in MMN) is affected by rarely encountered rules."}}, "95": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-4", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:30:00", "TalkEnd": "09:45:00", "Room": "Small auditorium", "Talk": "Models of Mismatch Responses - Moderators and Underlying Mechanisms", "Speaker": "Insa Schlossmacher", "Chair": "Insa Schlossmacher", "Inhalt": "Autor Insa Schlossmacher, \n\nPerceiving unexpected events is an important function of human perception and of utmost importance for survival.

Brain signatures in response to regularity violations in sensory inputs can give valuable insight into the computational principles underlying sequence perception and inference. Although previously reported for different senses, mismatch responses (MMRs) have largely been studied in isolation with a focus on the auditory system. Thus, many of the uni- and cross-modal aspects of mismatch processing remain unknown. We have inspected MMRs across the senses using a novel tri-modal roving stimulus paradigm in both EEG (study 1) and fMRI (study 2). The probabilistic sequences in the auditory, somatosensory and visual modality were defined by uni-modal transition probabilities and cross-modal conditional dependencies. We combined average-based approaches with single-trial computational modeling (study 1) and PPI-connectivity (study 2) to shed light on mismatch processing in the multi-sensory brain. Across sensory modalities we identified highly comparable response profiles of modality specific early signatures (MMN) as well as modality general late responses (P3). In addition to parametric dependence of MMRs on the number of stimulus repetitions, strikingly, we found sensitivity to cross-modal probabilistic dependencies, particularly at later latencies (P3) and within modality general hubs of the extended mismatch network (IPS). Model comparison indicated that the observed EEG dynamics were best captured by Bayesian learning models tracking uni-modal stimulus transitions as well as cross-modal conditional dependencies.

Prediction errors (PEs) have been shown to update memory and act as a teaching signal to the brain to guide future behaviour. Recent research has discovered a memory-promoting role of PEs in episodic memory formation. Here, we aimed to elucidate whether this PE-related memory enhancement is specific to the (predictive) stimulus that evoked the PE or whether the PE opens a transient window of enhanced memory encoding for all events that occur in this time window. In a combined incidental encoding-fear learning task, participants (n=78) saw a series of unique stimuli and estimated the probability that an aversive shock would follow. In 2 out of 4 encoding blocks, we presented entirely uninformative stimuli between the predictive stimulus and the outcome (i.e. potential PE). Memory was tested in a recognition test 24h later. Our data replicated the enhancing effects of aversive (signed) PEs on memory recognition that even go beyond arousal-related effects on memory formation. The PE-effect was specific to the predictive stimuli and not observed for uninformative stimuli presented between the predictive stimulus and the outcome. The mere presence of uninformative stimuli was shown to even abolish this PE-driven memory enhancement suggesting that PEs are sensitive to interference and may point to an involvement of working memory. Our findings may have relevant clinical implications, i.e. modulating memory by targeting individual expectations without pharmacological manipulations."}}}}, "session4-5": {"Index": "S21", "Talk": "The German National Cohort (NAKO) as a resource for mental health research", "Title": "S21 - The German National Cohort (NAKO) as a resource for mental health research", "Mantel": "The German National Cohort (NAKO) is a population-based prospective cohort study that investigates common diseases and their risk and protective factors.

All participants were scanned using identical 3 Tesla-MR scanners and protocols, covering brain structure and function together with musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and thoracoabdominal systems. State-of-the-art brain imaging processing protocols were applied, encompassing the extraction of grey and white matter volume, cortical thickness, white matter lesions, and functional connectivity metrics. Preliminary findings indicated high comparability across study centers with age-dependent decreases of grey matter volume, increases in cerebrospinal fluid and generally larger brain volumes in males. For white matter volume, these trends seemed to be non-linear. Furthermore, we found heterogeneous brain-behavior associations across cognitive domains. All associations were marked by high inter-individual variance. Finally, the data has been effectively utilized in a newly developed deep learning-based brain-age model. Commonly studied imaging biomarkers align with established theories of (cognitive) brain aging and sex differences, exhibiting high consistency across MR study sites.

This offers rich opportunity for the brain to exploit this structure for efficient ways to code and process information, e.g., by making and testing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Several theories suggest that making and testing predictions is implemented through top-down effects within cortical processing hierarchies. But how do such top-down effects affect neural processing in their respective target areas? I will propose that top-down predictions increase the separability of neural activity patterns in these areas. In support of this hypothesis, I will present data that show how predictions affect the separability of neural activity patterns in the macaque face-processing system, a 3-level processing hierarchy in the superior temporal sulcus. In particular, we find that in the presence of predictions, early stages of this hierarchy exhibit well separable and high-dimensional neural geometries otherwise characteristic only of the top of the hierarchy. This is accompanied by a systematic shift of tuning properties from higher to lower areas, endowing lower areas with higher-order, invariant representations instead of their feedforward tuning properties. Thus, top-down predictions dynamically transform neural representations of faces into separable and high-dimensional neural geometries. These results provide evidence how predictive context transforms flexible representational spaces to optimally use the computational resources provided by cortical processing hierarchies for better and faster distinction of visual inputs."}}, "103": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 5-1", "SessionStart": "12:45:00", "SessionEnd": "14:15:00", "TalkStart": "13:00:00", "TalkEnd": "13:15:00", "Room": "Room 1.12/1.13", "Talk": "Unravelling Visual Prediction: Insights from Electrophysiology, EEG, fMRI, and Computational Modelling", "Speaker": "Annika Garlichs", "Chair": "Helen Blank", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Arjen Alink, Wanlu Fu, Annika Garlichs, Lea-Maria Schmitt, Caspar Schwiedrzik, Co-Autoren: Janika Becker, Helen Blank, Benjamin Gagl, Floris de Lange, \n\nThe central role of predictions in visual perception prompts ongoing debates regarding how priors influence sensory processing, specifically whether, where, and when they increase or reduce representations of expected input.

We compared the representational dissimilarities of our neural data to hypothesized dissimilarities based on activations of a DCNN trained in face recognition (VGG-Face) as well as two object-trained DCNNs (VGG-16, ResNet50). Participants (N = 43) were cued to see face images, some generated by morphing two faces, leading to ambiguity in face identity. Expected faces were identified faster and perception of ambiguous faces was shifted towards the expected identity. Consistently across DCNNs, multivariate analyses uncovered evidence for PE processing across the face-processing hierarchy from the occipital face area (OFA), via the fusiform face area, to the anterior temporal lobe, and beyond in parietal and frontal regions.

How the human brain accomplishes this, however, remains an open question. In particular, it is unclear whether such integration enhances or reduces the neural encoding of expected stimuli, as postulated by the Bayesian brain theory and predictive coding respectively. To investigate this, we conducted an electroencephalography experiment aimed at measuring the relative encoding strength of expected and unexpected image components over time, using multivariate analysis of event-related potential (ERP) patterns across all electrodes. During the experiment, we presented repetitive predictable sequences of natural images while occasionally presenting an image overlay composed of the currently expected and an unexpected image (the expected and unexpected component respectively). ERP patterns evoked by natural images revealed robust information about image identity. Intriguingly, this identity information emerged already shortly before image onset (-200ms), which could reflect active anticipatory processes, i.e. the encoding of perceptual priors. Moreover, we found that ERP patterns evoked by the overlay images revealed increased stimulus identity encoding for expected image components during the early time window (120-160ms) while unexpected image component identity was more strongly encoded during a later time window (200-240ms).

Based on a transparent neurocognitive model, we postulated that readers optimize their percept by removing redundant visual signals, which allows them to focus on the informative aspects of the sensory input, i.e., the orthographic prediction error (oPE). Here, we test alternative oPE implementations by assuming all-or-nothing signaling units based on multiple thresholds and compare them to the original oPE implementation. For model evaluation, we implemented the comparison based on behavioral and electrophysiological data (EEG at 230, 430 ms). We found the highest model fit for the oPE with a 50% threshold integrating multiple prediction units for behavior and the late EEG component. The early EEG component was still explained best by the original hypothesis. In the final evaluation, we used image representations of both oPE implementations as input to a deep-neuronal network model (DNN). We compared the lexical decision performance of the DNN in two tasks (words vs. consonant strings; words vs. pseudowords) to the performance after training with unaltered word images and found better DNN performance when trained with the 50% oPE representations in both tasks. Thus, the new formulation is adequate for late but not early neuronal signals and lexical decision behavior in humans and machines. The change from early to late neuronal processing likely reflects an increase in the precision of the prediction error representation over time in preparation for accessing the meaning of words."}}}}, "session5-2": {"Index": "S23", "Talk": "Cognitive Aging", "Title": "S23 - Cognitive Aging", "Mantel": "In our modern aging society, individuals must function in their daily life well into old age.

Dysfunction or structural changes in the hippocampus have been linked to challenges in emotion regulation, decreased stress resilience and increased risk for depression and anxiety disorders. Understanding the impact of emotion regulation and estrogen on hippocampal volume thus provides valuable insights into mental health and emotional well-being. In order to disentangle the effects of estrogen and other gonadal hormones like progesterone or testosterone on neural plasticity we pharmacologically increased estradiol levels in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded design in young women in their early follicular menstrual cycle phase when gonadal hormone levels are low. Our preliminary data shows that the rapid increase of estrogen impacts bilateral parahippocampus volume. Furthermore, emotion regulation traits appear to be associated with right hippocampus volume. These findings suggest that individual differences in emotion regulation traits as well as the hormonal status are related to hippocampal volume. Therefore, estrogen and emotion regulation might present important protective functions for emotional well-being and mental health."}}, "114": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 5-3", "SessionStart": "12:45:00", "SessionEnd": "14:15:00", "TalkStart": "13:15:00", "TalkEnd": "13:30:00", "Room": "Room 1.18", "Talk": "The Brain on Gonadal Hormones: Uncovering the Interplay between Affect and Brain Dynamics", "Speaker": "Tobias Sommer", "Chair": "Anna Denninger", "Inhalt": "Autor Anna Denninger\n\nGonadal hormones, integral to the reproductive system in both sexes, appear to play a critical role in our everyday life regulating various physiological and psychological responses within the body and influencing our affective system including the stress response, emotion regulation, reward processing and mood.

Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a user-friendly and mobile modality that can measure and interpret brain activity in real-world BCI applications. In a series of studies using fNIRS and VR, we investigated visuospatial working memory and the dynamics that indicate learning progress. We analysed neuronal correlates using linear mixed-effects models and machine learning-based decoding. Our results revealed a non-linear relationship between working memory load and the hemodynamic response in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which can be used to identify learning progress. To further explore predictive brain signatures for state decoding, we investigated feature set decisions, including single feature contributions and their localization within the prefrontal cortex. The feature sets that combined oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (HbR) values using a sequential feature forward selection achieved the highest predictive performance. We found that the HbR peak-to-peak features from the premotor regions, as well as the right and mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, had the greatest impact on decoding performance. The research demonstrates the potential of fNIRS-based BCIs in applied VR learning scenarios and provides insights into the neuronal correlates of working memory load and associated learning progress. It enabled us to generate recommendations and identify challenges in developing online decoding pipelines for real-world VR-based BCI applications.

We examined the impact of the stimulus eccentricity in a VR headset (HTC Vive Pro) on two well-established EEG components observable during memory retention: the contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitude and alpha power lateralization. In a change detection task involving bilateral stimulus arrays with varying item counts (two or four) and eccentricities (4, 9, or 14 degrees of visual angle), we observed a significant load effect on the CDA amplitude at lower eccentricities but not at the highest, suggesting spatial constraints on memory encoding. Alpha lateralization remained unaffected by both memory load and eccentricity, indicating a more stable aspect of the related processing across spatial variations and different memory loads. Applying time-resolved spatial filters for decoding memory load from the event-related potential as well as from its time-frequency decomposition, we observed above-chance classification during memory retention for both signals and across all eccentricities.

To unravel the differences in retrieval of VR-based and PC-based engrams on the electrophysiological level, we investigated the neural correlates of retrieval processes underlying both in an initial study. After incidental encoding of photorealistic scenes either in VR or on a screen, we replicated the well-established theta old/new effect for the PC-condition, but remarkably, not for the VR-condition. As thetaband increases are related to top-down control on, and memory load during retrieval, the observed effect relates VR-engrams to less effortful retrieval compared to PC-engrams. The analysis of gammaband oscillations would allow for the precise differentiation of the underlying retrieval processes, complementing findings from the low-frequency range. However, 30-100Hz activity is particularly prone to electrical and extracerebral artefacts, impeding undisturbed signal acquisition while using immersive technologies. To lay the foundation for disentangling the processes underlying recognition memory, we demonstrated the feasibility of capturing oscillations in the high-frequency gamma-band range (30-100Hz) in VR in a second study.

To facilitate this practice, we reviewed and examined the accuracy of old and new ways to compute reliability in reaction time (RT) tasks. Using simulated data, we revealed that highly inaccurate reliability estimates are obtained by the common practice of averaging sets of trials and submitting them to Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Accurate reliability estimates were instead obtained by computing many random split-halves and aggregating the resulting correlations between both halves. Reliability estimation was further improved by ensuring each split-half contained an approximately equal number of trials for each stimulus. A further analysis revealed that autocorrelation, a common feature of reaction time tasks, can make reliability estimates larger than they should be under specific conditions. Specifically, autocorrelation always inflated the reliability of a simple RT average, and it inflated the reliability of difference scores in experimental designs where the conditions whose average RTs are contrasted were divided into separate blocks. Lastly, we examined the minimal number of split-halves that need to be averaged together to obtain a stable reliability estimate, finding a minimum of almost 9000 splits for median-based scores computed from the common sample size of 30 participants and 256 trials, whereas almost 7000 were required for mean-based scores given the same numbers of participants and trials.

We validated and improved the behavioural paradigm in three large-scale online experiments (N = 200, N = 205, N = 187). These data provided a precise and reliable estimate of the expected behavioural effect size, facilitating sample size calculations for the fMRI study. In addition, our results show that the interpretation of previous data on the effect of rewards for long-term memory is likely incomplete inasmuch as reward-stimulus associations contribute as much or more to reward effects on hit rate as a potential reward related facilitation of image encoding.

Next, Sercan Kahveci will offer a detailed comparison of methods for determining the split-half reliability of experimental tasks while highlighting best practices and giving hands-on recommendations for neuroscience researchers. Building upon this talk, Hilmar Zech will demonstrate how test-retest reliability of smartphone-based experimental tasks can be improved by pooling longitudinal data, and how this can improve neuroscientific research by linking task outcomes to real-world behaviors. Advancing to fMRI research, Juliane Nagel will showcase, how large-scale online experiments can be instrumental in improving the reliability and, ultimately, the replicability of costly fMRI experiments. Finally, Nils Kroemer will underscore the importance of assessing individual-level reliability in task research to foster translational research that links task outcomes to neurological disorders.

Consequently, the field has traditionally focused on the mapping of immutable (or \u201cfixed\u201d) brain responses within a population and most classical paradigms were intentionally optimized for low between-subject variability, providing strong and replicable main effects in group analyses. Today, fMRI has become a common tool for research on inter-individual differences in human cognition and this is of crucial relevance for translational research on alleged biomarkers of \u201cbrain\u201d disorders However, to classify people or predict their trajectories over time, a prerequisite is to formally establish that they can be reliably measured at an individual level, and to derive data-driven recommendations for the optimization of tasks. In the talk, I will summarize the recent progress toward improved psychometrics in fMRI research and showcase important tools and insights. Moreover, I will present examples of a workflow to improve task design via statistical and computational models of behavior and brain responses. In closing, I will provide an example from an ongoing study (current N=80) how repeated assessments of reinforcement learning using gamified online tasks can be combined with fMRI to improve robust modeling of behavior and its neural correlates. To conclude, quantitative research on the core components that make an fMRI design sufficiently reliable and, thereby, powerful should be seen as foundational to answer any question with translational ambitions."}}}}, "session6-2": {"Index": "S28", "Talk": "Down the habit hole: Where habitual and goal-directed control of behavior meet", "Title": "S28 - Down the habit hole: Where habitual and goal-directed control of behavior meet", "Mantel": "Behavior is generally thought to rely on either habitual or goal-directed control.

Thus, they reduce cognitive load in everyday life, but may also dominate behavior in addiction-like and compulsive psychopathologies. Due to their ubiquity and importance, it is essential to study their development. However, inducing and measuring habitual behavior in humans in the laboratory has proven difficult. In this Registered Report (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EQ9JD), we developed two novel behavioral tasks based on computational models that operationalize habits by the frequency of past behavior. We also included four previously used tasks and all three currently available self-report questionnaires of real-life habits to test the validity of all behavioral tasks. Extended testing of 220 participants on each of five consecutive days in the lab and an additional online session produced the most comprehensive dataset of habitual behavior to date. All data, code, and material have been publicly shared (https://osf.io/qjwht/) to encourage secondary analyses. Linear mixed-effects models and computational modeling of choice behavior revealed that past choice frequency influenced current choice and response time in addition to and independently of reinforcement. However, behavioral indices of choice frequency were not associated with measures of habit in the other four behavioral tasks. In addition, behaviors in these tasks were not meaningfully related to each other, and no behavioral task was related to self-report measures of real-life habits.

Importantly, current paradigms fail to differentiate whether habits result from deficits in goal-directed control or an overactive habit system. To overcome this, our study uses electroencephalography (EEG) to identify neural markers distinguishing between these two forms of behavioral control. Participants (N=35) underwent both minimal (1-day) and extensive (14-day) training sessions, where they learned to associate stimuli with key presses. Following these sessions, half of the stimulus-response pairings were reversed. In the test phase, response preparation times were manipulated: long preparation trials facilitate accurate performance of new mappings, while short preparation trials increase the likelihood of habitual errors consistent with the old mapping. EEG was recorded during both the training and test phases. As predicted, extensive training led to increased habitual errors compared to minimal training, particularly evident during short preparation times. I will present EEG findings highlighting the neural correlates of the underlying processes and how they relate to habitual errors. Frontal-midline theta (FM\u03b8) activity is proposed as the index for goal-directed control, while the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) is proposed to quantify habitual response preparation. By establishing neural signatures of both goal-directed and habitual control, we aim to explore how they interact and are influenced by individual differences.

Often, however, our behavior is not as variable as we would assume. Instead, there is a high likelihood that our current response will equal the response we gave on the last previous occurrence of the very same stimulus. This principle is captured in the law of recency (Giesen et al., 2020), which posits that action control processes often rely on retrieval of previous stimulus-response (SR) episodes from memory. Episodic retrieval will activate the response that was executed during the most recent episode in which the stimulus was presented before. Within the present talk, we will first provide evidence that recency retrieval of SR episodes explains a large part of color-word contingency learning (CL) effects. Still, after controlling for recency retrieval, a residual CL effect remains, which reflects the impact of global contingencies on behavior. Hence, in a second step, we will present data in which we tested the influence of contingency awareness on this residual CL effect by giving true or false instructions about the existing color-word contingencies. We found that the residual CL effect is modulated by awareness, as true (false) instructions amplified (reduced) the residual CL effect. Collectively, our findings suggest that color-word contingency learning is driven by two independent sources: (1) recency-based episodic retrieval which emerges by mere spatial temporal contiguity, and (2) application of contingency knowledge."}}, "135": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-2", "SessionStart": "14:30:00", "SessionEnd": "16:00:00", "TalkStart": "15:30:00", "TalkEnd": "16:00:00", "Room": "Small auditorium", "Talk": "Down the habit hole: Where habitual and goal-directed control of behavior meet", "Speaker": "Angela Brands", "Chair": "Stephan Nebe, Lieneke K.

In a preregistered study, we leverage this approach to compare a group of participants fulfilling on average 5.47 (SD=2.32) DSM-V criteria of disordered gambling (GD; N=30) with matched controls (MC; N=30) who performed a sequential RL-task during fMRI scanning. Participants from the GD group showed significantly lower task performance as well as diverging patterns in reaction times compared to the MC group, which was associated with dampened sensitivity to task contingencies. A well-established computational model extended to also account for higher order perseveration provided the best fit for both groups. Modelling results confirmed clearly reduced MB control in the GD group but further pointed to differences in habitual responding and reward guided behaviour at the second stage of the task. Analyses of the fMRI data are pending, and will test the prediction that impaired MB control in GD is linked to attenuated prefrontal control mechanisms. Current results mirror and extend previous research efforts, as they replicate reduced MB control in GD, but further allowing for a more detailed insight into additional underlying computational mechanisms at play and neural signatures associated with them.

For this purpose, psychosocial stress induction paradigms like ScanSTRESS are used, which systematically manipulate stress-eliciting key-components such as social-evaluative threat, negative feedback, and forced failure. Recently, it has been suggested that these components elicit distinct responses in the triple network, involving in particular structures of the salience and default mode network, but less those of the central executive network. Considering n = 500 ScanSTRESS data sets, the first mega-analysis in the context of stress imaging, performed with HALFpipe, showed that all structures of the triple network are involved in psychosocial stress processing, with the exception of the amygdala. This core region of the salience network showed increased activations only when individual cortisol increases were considered as a predictor for neural stress responses. This association between amygdala and cortisol stress response also exhibited a sex-specific pattern with positive associations between cortisol response and deactivations of the amygdala in men, but with activations of the amygdala in women. On this basis, for a sub-sample of n = 300 subjects it was further investigated, if structure- and task-based brain measures of the amygdala and other limbic structures like the hippocampus, rostral anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex can predict response trajectories of acute psycho-endocrine stress processing from baseline through acute to recovery phase.

In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS has been assessed at five sampling points (one year, three months, one week before the exam and one week, one month thereafter) and thus an exploratory trajectory-analysis using general linear models could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across timepoints. Our findings suggest that - in healthy young participants - neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety but not with depression scores.

Reviews and meta-analyses suggest that resilience is the most common response to exposure to adversity and stressors, making it an important outcome variable for psychophysiological stress research. This presentation discusses the use of a psychological stressor reactivity score to quantify mental resilience and as a potential prediction target for biomarkers of physiological stress reactivity. We recently proposed the calculation of a stressor reactivity score as an approximate estimate of mental resilience. This method first derives the normative stressor reactivity of a given sample as the positive relationship between stressor exposure and mental health problems. Individual stressor reactivity scores are then calculated as the deviation from this normative relationship via residualisation, and controlling for individual differences in stressor exposure. Thus, lower scores indicate an individual with lower than normative reactivity, and higher scores indicate greater than normative reactivity. A normatively positive relationship between stressor exposure and mental health problems is consistently found across multiple study populations and self-report methods. Stressor reactivity scores can thus be derived, and successfully control for within- and between-subject variation in stressor exposure. Individual stressor reactivity is predicted by relevant psychosocial resilience factors. The stressor reactivity score quantifies psychological stress responses via normative modelling and relative to individual stressor exposure. It is a promising and potentially more robust prediction target for physiological measures of stress reactivity for example compared to direct self-report of perceived stress."}}, "140": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-3", "SessionStart": "14:30:00", "SessionEnd": "16:00:00", "TalkStart": "15:30:00", "TalkEnd": "15:45:00", "Room": "Room 1.18", "Talk": "Central nervous biomarkers of stress and resilience in the lab and in everyday life: Predictions and considerations ", "Speaker": "Meike D.

This modulatory role makes the study of myelin trajectories a compelling focus to understand the link between cortical maturation and behavioral adaptation, that is, resilience and susceptibility. Here, we investigated whether intra-individual development of adolescents\u2019 psychosocial functioning in response to environmental adversity is linked to ongoing myeloarchitectural maturation and downstream effects on functional reorganization. We operationalized resilient outcomes as comparatively lower levels of psychosocial distress than predicted from stressor exposure (including adverse life events, family settings, and socioeconomic status). This machine learning approach provided continuous resilience scores adjusted for variations in stressor exposure at different time points. We then extracted intra-cortical myeloarchitectural profiles from myelin-sensitive imaging to capture myelination and depth-dependent trajectories of systems-level synchronization. Our findings suggest that developing towards more resilient psychosocial functioning is linked to a higher rate of prefrontal myelination alongside stabilized functional connectivity within abstract cognitive networks. Moreover, we observed stronger cortex-wide myeloarchitectural reorganization of association cortices, paralleled by attenuated functional change. Conversely, adolescents who became more susceptible to stressors exhibited maturational trajectories more closely tied to earlier stages of adolescence, as well as decreasing prefrontal connectivity. Together, trajectories of resilient psychosocial functioning link to ongoing myelin plasticity \u2013 reflected in both local growth and globally synchronized intra-cortical differentiation \u2013 and is paralleled by functional adaptation."}}}}, "session6-4": {"Index": "S30", "Talk": "Neural correlates of conscious experience: progress and challenges", "Title": "S30 - Neural correlates of conscious experience: progress and challenges", "Mantel": "How does our brain generate consciousness, that is, our subjective experience of what it is like to see or feel?

Accordingly, the main event-related potential (ERP) candidates for neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) are the early visual awareness negativity (VAN) and the late positivity (LP). Another central question is whether perceptual awareness is a graded or an all-or-none phenomenon. Recent studies have demonstrated that both VAN and LP gradually increase with the level of awareness. However, they systematically confounded conscious perception with task-related post-perceptual processes (e.g., decision-making). The present study investigated neural correlates of gradual awareness in the absence of decision-making. Awareness was manipulated using the attentional blink (AB), where conscious perception of a first visual target (T1) impairs reporting a second target (T2) presented in rapid succession. Decision-making processes at the time of T2 presentation were impeded by omitting a discrimination task on T2 stimuli and rendering their relevance uncertain. Importantly, unlike in no-report studies with limited awareness assessment, participants reported the subjective visibility of T2 using a four-level perceptual awareness scale (PAS) in each trial. The analysis of T2-locked ERPs as a function of subjective visibility revealed that awareness was associated with a VAN and \u2013 in contrast to a LP \u2013 a late centroparietal negativity.

How exactly our brain generates this conscious experience has become a matter of rigorous research and intense scientific debate. According to influential models, conscious perception requires the active working-memory-like maintenance of information via synchronous thalamocortical activity, cortical recurrence, or the sustained recruitment of parieto-prefrontal areas in a global neuronal workspace. Non-conscious perception, on the flip-side, is short-lived, with non-conscious stimuli rarely affecting behavior or brain responses beyond a couple hundred milliseconds. I will present behavioral, eye-tracking, and magnetoencephalography evidence questioning these widely-held assumptions. Combining a spatial-delayed response paradigm with visual masking, in several experiments, we show that (i) non-conscious information may be maintained for several seconds, (ii) this long-lasting blindsight effect possesses several features characteristic of working memory, and (iii) it may even support longer-term learning of statistical dependencies.

In this paradigm, participants performed a visual distractor task with line stimuli presented in the background, which sometimes contained an abstract human face for either 500 or 1000 ms. Half of the participants were informed of the presence of the face, resulting in faces being perceived by the informed but not by the uninformed participants.

In the first study, we manipulated stimulus duration (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5s) while measuring brain activation with high spatio-temporal resolution using invasive EEG. We found that posterior cortex activation was coupled with duration, while prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited only transient activation at stimulus onset.

For instance, predicting the location of your gate in a foreign airport when racing to catch a connecting flight. By leveraging intuitions about regularities in the spatial composition of other airports, certain schemas may seem more likely than others. Understanding the meaning of the whole based on the parts and the way they are syntactically combined is known as \"compositionality\", and is argued to be a unique feature of human cognition, distinguishing us from other animals and AI. However, seemingly contradictory implications arise: is compositionality cheap or costly? On the one hand, compositionality allows for simpler and more compact programs, but on the other hand, the combinatorial explosion of hypothesis space makes search exceedingly difficult. Here, we use time pressure to manipulate the availability of cognitive resources in a compositional maze task, to better understand the costs of compositional hypothesis generation. A hidden path is described using a compositional grammar formed from spatial primitives, with participants asked to navigate to the goal with as few wrong moves as possible. While time pressure led to more random errors, it did not impair a preference for testing hypotheses with greater compositional structure, suggesting it is more robust and cheap than previously expected. Our winning model accounts for this bias based on the creative re-use of previously observed structure, providing a complementary perspective to recent approaches using program induction requiring costly inference. Ultimately, this work lays the groundwork towards a resource-rational perspective of compositionality."}}, "148": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-5", "SessionStart": "14:30:00", "SessionEnd": "16:00:00", "TalkStart": "15:00:00", "TalkEnd": "15:15:00", "Room": "Room 0.12/0.13", "Talk": "Cognitive Schemas and Memory Generalization", "Speaker": "Nicolas Schuck ", "Chair": "Mona Garvert, Monika Sch\u00f6nauer", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Mona Garvert, Monika Sch\u00f6nauer\n\nTo navigate a complex world successfully, we need to gather knowledge about the rules that govern it.

I will present data from two experiments using game-like tasks that suggest that orbitofrontal cortex, and to some extent also the hippocampus, are important for within-task generalisations. In one study, participants navigated an agent to two successive goal locations in a grid world environment comprising four interlinked rooms. Over time participants could learn how events in one room would generalize to other rooms. Participants learned quickly, and representations in both the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex changed to reflect the dimensions of generalisation. In another study, participants navigated in a set of six mazes, each consisting of six rooms that had to be visited multiple times. We again find that participants quickly learn which experiences they can generalise across rooms and mazes. We also find that orbitofrontal cortex forms representations that reflect the tasks underlying generalisation structure. Notably, we do not find such representations in the hippocampus in this case, and discovered that OFC representations change with time. Taken together, these findings shed important insights into the function of OFC and hippocampus for generalisation."}}, "149": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-5", "SessionStart": "14:30:00", "SessionEnd": "16:00:00", "TalkStart": "15:15:00", "TalkEnd": "15:30:00", "Room": "Room 0.12/0.13", "Talk": "Cognitive Schemas and Memory Generalization", "Speaker": "Felix Deilmann ", "Chair": "Mona Garvert, Monika Sch\u00f6nauer", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Mona Garvert, Monika Sch\u00f6nauer\n\nTo navigate a complex world successfully, we need to gather knowledge about the rules that govern it.

Organizing relations between sensory stimuli, like state-transition probabilities, within an adequate internal representation facilitates flexible panning, fast learning of novel relations, and generalization of rewards. However, states may simultaneously share different types of relational information, including reward contingencies. Here, we use fMRI to investigate how a subsequently learned latent reward structure influences the neural representation of relational knowledge. We also examine potential neural mechanisms facilitating the generalization and inference of relational knowledge. Participants initially obtain knowledge about object (state) relations based on a hidden graph structure. Behavioral data suggest that participants successfully acquired structural knowledge and utilized it to find shortcuts between states of the graph. In a subsequent decision-making task, fluctuating reward values were associated with each state. Critically, two parts of the graph shared identical reward contingencies. Our modeling results indicate that participants could abstract the underlying latent reward structure and generalize over states sharing the same reward contingencies. Furthermore, participants applied their relational knowledge and abstracted reward contingencies to correctly infer reward values of states that they never directly experienced. fMRI adaptation analysis results indicate separate representations of the underlying structure and reward contingency in the hippocampal-formation and vmPFC. Finally, multivariate decoding analysis indicates reinstatement of congruent and related states as a plausible neural mechanism supporting the generalization of reward contingencies. Overall, our findings demonstrate how a distinct representation of experienced transitions and shared reward contingencies between states enables generalization and inference."}}, "150": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-5", "SessionStart": "14:30:00", "SessionEnd": "16:00:00", "TalkStart": "15:30:00", "TalkEnd": "15:45:00", "Room": "Room 0.12/0.13", "Talk": "Cognitive Schemas and Memory Generalization", "Speaker": "Philipp Paulus", "Chair": "Mona Garvert, Monika Sch\u00f6nauer", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Mona Garvert, Monika Sch\u00f6nauer\n\nTo navigate a complex world successfully, we need to gather knowledge about the rules that govern it.

To do so, we draw both on our explicit knowledge of past experiences as well as our implicit understanding of the rules that govern our environment. These two sources of knowledge are supported by complementary learning and memory systems: An explicit memory system mediated by the hippocampus and an implicit memory system that is associated with striatal circuits. Sleep has been suggested as one potential mechanism that mediates the complementary influences of explicit vs. implicit memories on behavior. Here, we trained participants on a feedback-driven categorization task in which they had to choose the winner item in a series of object comparisons. The task could be solved by explicitly remembering individual exemplars or by inferring the implicit information integration rule that determined the object hierarchy. We find that sleep resolves competition between memory representations from these disparate sources to support both explicit memory as well as rule-based inferences. Participants who slept after training exhibited a better cooperative use of implicit and explicit knowledge, as well as better rule-transfer abilities in an inference task. Patterns of brain activity mirror these results: the sleep group showed stronger activity in the hippocampus during rule inference and stronger activity in the striatum during exemplar recall. Sleep may thus help us to optimally combine information acquired in multiple memory systems to support flexible behavior."}}}}}}, "poster": {"topics": {"Learning, Memory, and Sleep": {"0": {"Id": "006", "Title": "Learning from Emotional Feedback in Younger and Older Adults: An ERP-Study", "Submitter_fName": "Jana Isabelle", "Submitter_lName": "Braunwarth", "Submitter_Initials": "J.

With a prevalence of 23%, fatigue is described as one of the most common and most distressing symptoms of the post-COVID. The cognitive form of fatigue is manifested by concentration and memory problems, word-finding difficulties and decreased attention performance. Etiologic explanations of the symptomatology include maladaptive changes in fatigue-associated fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical networks, particularly frontoparietal hypoactivity, as well as inflammation-related changes and impaired cortical blood flow regulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS] enhances cortical blood flow and modulates excitability of cortical areas. Repetitive application of anodal tDCS on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC] has been shown to improve fatigue in post-COVID patients. In the preset study, we investigated the effect of anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC on post COVID-related fatigue and fatigability 40 post-COVID-patients. The patients were randomly assigned to receive four sessions of either verum or sham stimulation in a double-blind manner. EEG was recorded before and after to evaluate fatigability related changes in alpha and theta oscillations as well as the auditory p50 component as a sensory gating parameter. Subjective fatigue ratings were evaluated using the MFIS and general subjective health was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L. Additionally, we collected blood samples before and after stimulation and assessed immune parameters. The results show that demographic, electrophysiological, and immunological parameters are effective in predicting both subjective and objective fatigue and have also the potential to optimise the prediction of stimulation effects.

To date, the majority of NF studies have focused on regional brain activation, but there are emerging approaches that target brain network properties (i.e., functional connectivity (FC) estimates) or brain activation patterns (using machine learning algorithms, e.g., support vector machine (SVM)). We compared three NF approaches for the motor cortex (MC) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy in 57 healthy participants regarding the underlying processes. In all groups, participants were able to regulate their MC activation, but without learning progress across sessions. FC-NF and single-region neurofeedback (SR-NF) resulted in a higher proportion of learning than SVM-NF. Regarding the underlying processes, no specific effects for the respective training parameters emerged from the different protocols (e.g., FC-NF members did not modulate connectivity but MC amplitude, similar to SR-NF members). In a pre-post motor task, reaction times decreased more in SR-NF and learners compared to non-learners. Accuracy increased after NF and was higher in NF learners. MC activation increased over time for learners and decreased for non-learners. Task load decreased over the sessions, but was higher in SVM-NF than in FC-NF. Motivation was higher among non-learners than among learners. In summary, SR-NF and FC-NF led to comparable results that were superior to the SVM-NF implemented here. Unexpectedly, the training parameters were not specifically modulated depending on the training protocol. However, NF learners differed from non-learners with respect to several outcome measures.

First, I will show how the amygdala electrical fingerprint (AmyEFP), a functional magnetic resonance imaging-informed electroencephalography (EEG) signature, can be used as an EEG proxy of deep-brain activation for NF training and has already proven its feasibility in Borderline Personality Disorder. Next, I will elucidate on the timing of the feedback in NF training alongside affective stimuli. In a study with 102 healthy participants, we compared continuous and intermittent feedback during AmyEFP-NF. Both groups showed significant learning effects in downregulation; however, the intermittent feedback showed a more straightforward learning curve among the training sessions, suggesting that separating the processes of regulation and feedback interpretation reduces the complexity of the interface and leads to faster progress in learning. Finally, in the same study, we investigated the use of mental strategies during NF training.

To unravel this relationship, we investigated the correspondence between physiological reactions and subjective arousal and valence, using representational similarity analysis. In two independent samples (discovery sample, N= 483, replication sample N= 64) and three affect-inducing tasks (passive picture viewing, passive sound listening, imagery tasks), SCR and startle responses, as readouts of arousal and valence, respectively, were compared to models of subjective affect that either assume similar or dissimilar physiological responding among trials evoking comparable affective experiences.

However, little is known about the temporal stability of the physiological changes during fear conditioning across repeated measurements which is a crucial consideration for making (long-term) individual-level predictions. 120 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, repeating fear acquisition and extinction twice within a 6-month period. Temporal stability of conditioned responses was assessed using SCR and BOLD fMRI using a representational similarity analysis (RSA)-related approach. We thereby investigated whether an individual's baseline responses were more similar to their own (within-subject similarity) or to those of others (between-subject similarity) at the 6-month follow-up. Mostly, SCRs of one individual at baseline were not more similar to responses of the same individual at follow-up than compared to others at follow-up indicating limited temporal stability across 6 months. However, for BOLD fMRI, within-subject similarity was significantly higher compared to between-subject similarity during acquisition, but not extinction. It will be discussed whether these results indicate that BOLD fMRI may be more stable over time than SCRs at an individual level or whether RSA-inspired approaches might be more sensitive to detecting BOLD fMRI individual-level similarity compared to that of SCRs.

Yet, only a few studies exist investigating the genetic architecture of these dimensions as well as their associated genetically predicted risk and protective factors. Methods: To estimate the latent internalizing and externalizing dimensions, we used genomic structural equation modeling with genome-wide association study summary data for individual disorders from these spectra. The genetic information of the latent dimensions served two purposes: a) elucidating their biological underpinnings by a tissue expression enrichment analysis, and b) evaluating the causal relationship among various risk factors on these dimensions through Mendelian Randomization. The risk factors included vitamin D, alcohol consumption, childhood maltreatment, and self-reported physical activity. Results: Indices from the common factor models indicated a good model fit, with moderate to strong loadings of individual disorders on the internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Genetically predicted childhood maltreatment (OR=2.64; 95%-CI: 1.52-4.60; P=5.80x10-04) and alcohol consumption (OR=1.51; 95%-CI: 1.32-1.74; P=6.13x10-09) were consistently associated with the externalizing dimension across various sensitivity analyses.

METHODS: Our analysis involved 19,183 participants drawn from the UK Biobank imaging cohort. Depression status and adverse life experiences were determined through questionnaire data, while genetic susceptibility to depression was quantified using polygenic scores. We assessed the integrity of 27 white matter tracts by analyzing mean fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Individuals displaying depressive symptoms exhibited reduced white matter integrity, particularly noticeable in thalamic and intracortical fiber tracts, regardless of their current symptom severity. In a cohort of non-depressed individuals, heightened genetic predisposition and increased exposure to adverse life events correlated with decreased integrity in relevant fiber tracts, particularly within thalamic radiations. Notably, this association surpassed what would be expected based solely on statistical correlations between samples, a finding corroborated by subsequent in silico simulations and permutation tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that alterations in white matter integrity within thalamic and association tracts are linked to both depressive symptoms and genetic susceptibility to depression in individuals not currently affected by the condition.

The memory function of sleep relies on a delicate interplay of physiological mechanisms facilitating memory reprocessing during sleep. Yet, sleep is not occurring in a vacuum and many factors influence sleep-related neural processes with significant down-stream effects on cognitive functioning. It is therefore crucial to investigate how the sleeping brain codes and reprocesses information, how different factors influence these mechanisms and how this might affect memory functioning.\nWithin this symposium, we will initially focus on consolidation-related neural processes obtained by intracranial and surface electrophysiology and how experimental interventions such as targeted memory reactivation (TMR) can alter sleep-physiological markers and memory consolidation. We then broaden the perspective by considering how sleep-related consolidation processes and their manipulation can be harnessed to benefit cognitive functioning in both tRooma treatment and everyday life.\nFirstly, Michael Hahn presents intracranial sleep data on neural population coding efficiency as a mechanism for sleep-related memory consolidation. Thomas Schreiner then examines the relevance of sleep oscillations for TMR triggered memory reactivation using intracranial recordings.

Synaptic scaling models suggest that learning during wakefulness accumulates neural information, which is then consolidated and downregulated during sleep. Yet, there's a lack of in-vivo data elucidating how sleep normalizes information processing capacities in humans and rodents. From an information-theoretical perspective, the consolidation process during sleep should reduce neural pattern variability. Here, in a cross-species study, we found a tradeoff in the neural population code during sleep, with the neocortex displaying higher information coding efficiency compared to the archicortex, humans compared to rodents, and wakefulness compared to sleep. Critically, non-REM sleep specifically decreases information coding efficiency in the neocortex, likely reflecting neural pattern recapitulation. The hippocampus however shows a consistent but more redundant population code across sleep stages. These results support the neocortex's role in long-term memory storage. Moreover, task engagement enhances coding efficiency, while induced unconsciousness disrupts the population code. In summary, neural pattern variability is crucial for cognitive engagement and memory formation, with repetitive patterns likely aiding in the consolidation process."}}, "164": {"Tag": "Samstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 7-4", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:15:00", "TalkEnd": "09:30:00", "Room": "Small auditorium", "Talk": "Up-regulating and down-regulating memory functions by influencing sleep", "Speaker": "Thomas Schreiner ", "Chair": "Nora Ro\u00fcast, Thomas Schreiner", "Inhalt": "Autor Nora Ro\u00fcast, Co-Autor: Thomas Schreiner\n\nIt is well established that sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.

To investigate whether random acoustic stimulation during sleep affects sleep physiology and thereby memory consolidation, 25 subjects took part in a two-session nap study.

Despite retaining a stable sleep duration, stimulation disrupted deeper sleep stages and especially slow oscillations, assessed via delta power calculations and distinct features of the slow oscillations.

During ImRs, the traumatic memory is imagined, \"rescripted\" with the aim of changing the meaning of the experience and then re-integrated into long-term memory in the modified form. The stable and lasting consolidation of the modified memory is essential for the success of the therapy. Fundamental research has shown that processes of memory consolidation take place primarily during sleep. This consolidation can be optimized by the presentation of memory cues. This study investigated whether the effect of ImRs can be further enhanced by nocturnal exposure to odour cues that have already been presented during the ImRs sessions. Methods: Patients received 12 ImR-sessions during which an odour was presented. In the nights between therapy sessions, patients were presented with either the same odour (congruent condition) or a new odour (congruent condition). The main outcome measure was PTSD-symptoms assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 at 1-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial functioning, trauma-associated cognitions as well as subjective and objective sleep quality. Results: Patients showed an improvement in PTSD-symptoms and secondary outcomes. Preliminary results of the first data show a trend towards faster and greater improvement of symptoms in the congruent condition. In-depth analyses of sleep data to uncover possible underlying mechanisms of this effect are currently being conducted. Discussion: Odour cues could be an effective tool to support trauma-focused therapy.

Exercise, on the other hand, has garnered attention for its independent benefits on memory and sleep. However, the interplay between exercise, sleep, and memory encoding remains largely unexplored. In our study, we delved into this relationship by examining the effects of two evening exercise interventions on sleep patterns (tracked via actigraphy) and subsequent memory encoding. Our findings revealed a notable positive impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on memory encoding. First, we observed that participants displayed enhanced early encoding of word pairs in the HIIT condition compared to the control condition. Second, we observed a significant increase in memory encoding for low-performing participants in the HIIT condition compared to the control condition. Interestingly, this enhancement persisted for at least 24 hours. Conversely, moderate-intensity exercise yielded no discernible effects on memory. There were also no changes in sleep parameters.

Participants completed a dynamic sound localization paradigm in which they were presented with a sequence of sounds at varying locations. After each sound, participants made a two-alternative forced choice judgment, indicating its spatial location (left vs. right). Critically, in a subset of occasions, but unbeknown to the participants, the sounds were presented at a central location, creating a situation of maximal spatial uncertainty. Furthermore, in the first half of the sound sequence, sound presentation could be accompanied by a task-irrelevant bimodal odorant stimulation (i.e., isopropanol) in the left, right, or both nostrils. In addition, odorant-free auditory-only trials served as a baseline condition. Under conditions of high spatial uncertainty (i.e., central sounds), the proportion of right-ward responses increased with right-nostril odorant stimulation but decreased with left-nostril stimulation (relative to the two control conditions). This effect was only present in the second half of the sound sequence, suggesting an after-effect of odorant-stimulation. Confirming the successful manipulation of spatial attention, we observed a significant lateralization of posterior alpha-band power in response to a physically non-lateralized sound.

Here, we tested this assumption using both behavioral and EEG measures. Participants were presented with 150 visual patterns, with two patterns repeated approximately every fifth trial. On each trial, we measured 1) working memory performance, indicating the amount of information which could be maintained over a short time interval, 2) participants' recognition of pattern repetitions, and 3) recorded EEG during stimulus encoding. Behavioral results revealed that working memory performance improved only after participants had recognized a repeated pattern. Additionally, recognition of pattern repetition strongly correlated with the emergence of the P600, an ERP component associated with explicit memory retrieval processes. Yet, this signature manifested only after participants reported awareness of the repetition; prior to repetition awareness, ERPs were indistinguishable from unrepeated patterns, and no benefit in working memory performance was observed.
