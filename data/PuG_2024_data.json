Using a large sample of participants (n = 156), across four diagnostic groups including obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and a naturalistic control group, we examined the influence of disorder category, clinical status, family risk, and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions (anxious apprehension and anxious arousal). The research objectives and methodology were preregistered prior to data collection (https://osf.io/kxv5h) and the dataset as well as the analytic code have been deposited in an OSF repository (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/7DCM3). Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not observe significant ERN or CRN differences among the diagnostic groups. However, when compared to a strictly defined healthy control group, individuals with specific phobia exhibited a larger ERN, a novel finding. In line with previous work, individuals with a lifetime clinical diagnosis of any internalizing disorder or with a family risk for internalizing psychopathology showed larger ERN and CRN amplitudes. After combining our data with a subclinical sample (n = 246), we identified gender as a moderator, with women exhibiting higher levels of anxious apprehension showing an elevated ERN and CRN. In conclusion, our study challenges the notion of a disorder-specific link to performance monitoring. Instead, our findings suggest that enhanced performance monitoring is associated with a higher propensity for anxious apprehension and acts as a broad risk marker for internalizing psychopathology, reflecting vulnerability beyond diagnostic borders within the anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive spectrum."}}, "1": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "10:45:00", "TalkEnd": "11:00:00", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Rosa Gr\u00fctzmann", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

Here, we present two studies focusing on different applications of these psychophysiological markers. In study 1, an executive control training targeting the error-related negativity (ERN) was applied in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies have shown that the robust increase of the ERN in OCD might reflect a risk marker and that it persists after cognitive-behavioral therapy despite successful symptom reduction, thus possibly demanding for specifically-tailored interventions. Results of study 1 showed a slight reduction of the ERN and OCD symptoms after the three-week executive control training thus strengthening its potential as a target for augmentative interventions. Study 2 focused on the potential contributions of psychophysiological markers for the diagnostic classification of problematic internet use (PIU). As PIU exhibits features of behavioral addiction but is also associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms its placement across the internalizing-externalizing spectrum is currently being discussed. Thus, psychophysiological markers of performance monitoring (ERN), reward processing (reward-related positivity, rewP), and inhibition (N2, P300) were assessed and results were compared to established patterns in addiction vs. internalizing disorders. Across all three tasks the results of study 2 rather favor the classification of PIU as an internalizing disorder. Taken together, the two studies illustrate the potential for application of the mechanistic insights derived from cross-sectional psychophysiological studies in additional areas of clinical research such as the development of novel interventions and diagnostic classification."}}, "2": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "11:00:00", "TalkEnd": "11:15:00", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Hannes Per Carsten", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

The majority of patients with OCD engage in repetitive checking, which might be a phenotypic expression of increased error monitoring. To test a causal link between checking behavior and the ERN, a preregistered, randomized-controlled design was employed. First, the baseline (T0) ERN of N = 90 university students was measured via electroencephalography during an Eriksen Flanker Task. Then, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: While an experimental group (n = 30) was instructed to repetitively check kitchen devices in a virtual reality (VR) environment, an active control group (n = 30) waited in the same VR environment, and a passive control group (n = 30) waited without a VR headset. Subsequently (T1), the ERN was assessed again. The checking induction resulted in an increased ERN after symptom induction (T1) in the experimental group compared with the active control group. This effect was specific to the ERN, as no differences in the correct-related negativity (CRN) emerged. Repetitive Checking in a virtual environment seems to impact the ERN, in line with previous cross-sectional studies. This finding implies that checking compulsions, which are highly prevalent among patients with OCD, might be a phenotypic expression of an increased ERN. Future studies could extend these findings to clinical samples with OCD."}}, "3": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "11:15:00", "TalkEnd": "11:30:00", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Mareike Bayer", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

In this simultaneous EEG-fMRI study, we investigate the role of personal relevance in emotional face processing in ASC. Participants with ASC and matched controls (N=46) performed an emotion recognition task including a personally relevant person and a matched stranger, displaying fearful, happy, and neutral facial expressions. Both groups showed significantly increased hemodynamic activity for relevant vs. stranger\u2019s faces in the core and extended face processing network, including fusiform gyrus, medial PFC and precuneus. Crucially, emotion effects in ASC were limited to relevant faces, while the control group showed emotion effects for both relevant and unknown faces. In EEG data, increased P1 amplitudes to relevant vs. stranger\u2019s faces were observed only for the non-autistic group, while later effects (P3) were present for both groups. In addition, cross-modal representational similarity analyses (RSA) analyses revealed that significant shared representations between EEG and fMRI data at sensory stages were again limited to the control group. Our results indicate that face processing in ASC seems to be characterised by a higher specificity, rather than a general dysfunction. Furthermore, EEG data revealed differences in the temporal profile of face processing, where modulations at sensory stages were limited to the control group. Our results speak to the importance of using individualized stimuli and multi-modal analyses in order to allow for the investigation of real-life social information processing in clinical populations."}}, "4": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 1-1", "SessionStart": "10:30:00", "SessionEnd": "12:00:00", "TalkStart": "11:30:00", "TalkEnd": "11:45:00", "Talk": "Exploring new approaches to increase utility of psychophysiological markers for clinical psychology", "Speaker": "Julia Klawohn ", "Chair": "Julia Klawohn, Hannes Per Carsten", "Inhalt": "Autor Julia Klawohn, Co-Autor: Hannes Per Carsten,\n\nIn recent years, biological markers have increasingly been incorporated into clinical research, showing they can further our knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health problems and help identify new vantage points for interventions.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an effective treatment for OCD, yet a significant number of patients do not sufficiently respond to intervention. In line with recent advances in individualized medicine approaches, neurocognitive biomarkers could help identify individuals at risk for non-response and provide insight into underlying mechanisms. Here, we examined whether the late positive potential (LPP), a neural correlate of emotional reactivity, could serve as a prospective predictor of therapy response in patients with OCD (n = 100). Results indicated gender-moderated prediction of therapy response by LPP to unpleasant and pleasant emotional pictures. That is, female patients with relatively higher reactivity to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli were more likely to benefit from CBT, possibly through lower emotional avoidance. Moreover, findings from the same sample suggest that higher resting heart-rate-variability (HRV) also is a predictor of greater symptom reduction through CBT, particularly in female patients with OCD. As HRV has been discussed as a marker of flexible implicit emotion regulation, these findings align to indicate that both biological measures of emotional responsivity can serve as clinical prognostic markers in OCD, with blunting in responsivity being predictive of higher risk for non-response to CBT. Implications of these findings with respect to the clinical utility of such markers and further directions will be discussed."}}}}, "session1-2": {"Index": "S02", "Talk": "Leveraging Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data in the Cognitive Neurosciences: Implementations, Insights, and Challenges", "Title": "S02 - Leveraging Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data in the Cognitive Neurosciences: Implementations, Insights, and Challenges", "DatePlace": "Donnerstag 10:30 - 12:00 | Ort TODO", "Chair": {"author": "Norman Forschack", "uni": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "Mantel": "Electrophysiological recordings have been instrumental in unraveling the brain's functional dynamics, offering insights into neural processes underlying perception, cognition, and behavior.

With these techniques, one can obtain two main types of neuronal dynamics: evoked responses and oscillations. As a general rule, evoked responses and oscillations are considered distinct types of activity. However, we suggest that a number of evoked responses and oscillations should not be regarded as different neuronal phenomena but rather can be viewed as one and the same process. Those oscillations that have an asymmetry in the amplitude and undergo modulation by the stimulus will unavoidably generate an evoked response. In a series of studies, we show that the most abundant rhythm in the human brain\u2014the alpha rhythm\u2014has an asymmetry in the amplitude and, when perturbed by the stimulus or internal event, indeed generates slow, long-lasting evoked responses. We demonstrate that this is the case for late visual evoked response, P300, and the readiness potential. In particular, at between- and within-participant levels, the extent of alpha amplitude modulation directly translates to a change in the amplitude of the evoked response. Therefore, we advocate for the analysis of oscillatory dynamics in order to be able to neurophysiologically interpret the changes in evoked responses.

Attention, however, fluctuates, leading to varying behavioral responses over time. At the same time, it is assumed that attentional selection may be implemented by different neural mechanisms, as indicated by repeatedly found attentional changes of different and unrelated neural measures such as early sensory gain or visual and motor alpha-band activity. We here probed whether attention-modulated trial-by-trial fluctuations of these measures are predictive of behavioral responses. For this purpose, in an EEG experiment with a classical visuo-spatial attention task, arrows validly, invalidly, or neutrally cued a to be discriminated stimulus. Single-trial flicker-driven Steady-State-Visual-Evoked-Potentials (SSVEPs), visual and motor alpha-band activity were measured in a cue-target interval and their relationship with reaction times was modeled via Bayesian regression models. We found that these neural measures and behavioral responses were overall modulated by the attentional cue. Yet, while SSVEP amplitudes were not associated with behavior, single-trial alpha-band amplitudes were predictive of reaction times: For trials with a valid or neutral cue, lower amplitudes of visual and motor alpha-band activity contralateral to the target (and for valid cues also higher amplitudes ipsilateral to the target) were associated with faster responses. For invalid cues, however, which required re-allocating attention to the uncued side, no relationship was found.

Here we tested whether these time-on-task changes in EEG activity are limited to activity in the alpha band and whether they are linked to task performance. Thirty-six participants performed 900 trials of a two-alternative forced choice visual discrimination task with confidence ratings. Pre- and post-stimulus spectral power (1-40Hz) and aperiodic (i.e., non-rhythmic) components were compared across blocks of the experimental session and tested for relationships with behavioural performance. We found that time-on-task effects on rhythmic EEG activity were primarily localised within the alpha band, with alpha power increasing and peak alpha frequency decreasing over time. Importantly, time-on-task effects explained variability in single-trial reaction times and both, alpha frequency, and power. Moreover, controlling for time-on-task effectively removed the relationship between alpha activity and reaction times.  However, time-on-task effects did not affect other EEG signatures of behavioural performance, including post-stimulus predictors of single-trial decision confidence.

For example, ERP analysis considers the mean EEG response over trials, while spectral analysis often considers the mean amplitude in a specific frequency range. Although the mean-based approach has proved useful, it is becoming clear that trial-to-trial fluctuations in neural activity are in fact also informative, representing beneficial variability that is typically strongly linked to behaviour. In particular, I will show that higher variability, as measured in entropy (a measure of signal unpredictability), is generally linked to greater cognitive flexibility and the ability to maintain stable task performance when conditions become more challenging. Notably, entropy continues to explain behaviour even when accounting for conventional EEG measures such as spectral power and ERPs, suggesting a unique contribution to the neural underpinnings of cognition. The inherently variable nature of brain activity could even begin to help understand why classification of cognitive states based on predictable, repeating patterns in neural data, as is typically done in machine learning, is generally not very accurate. Together, our results suggest that trial-to-trial neural variability is crucial for the remarkable ability of humans to cognitively adapt to an ever-changing environment."}}}}, "session1-3": {"Index": "S03", "Talk": "Cognitive Brain States from a Network Neuroscience Perspective ", "Title": "S03 - Cognitive Brain States from a Network Neuroscience Perspective ", "DatePlace": "Donnerstag 10:30 - 12:00 | Ort TODO", "Chair": {"author": "Kirsten Hilger", "uni": "W\u00fcrzburg University"}, "Mantel": "Brain states are recurring patterns of distributed brain activity.

Our neuroimaging method investigated changes over time in two complementing indicators of structural und functional brain network organization: myelin-sensitive T1 relaxometry and cortical functional gradients. Significant alterations in microstructure and intrinsic brain function were noted, and these differences varied according to the social training undertaken. Specifically, attention-mindfulness and socio-cognitive training altered microstructure and intrinsic function in areas functionally linked to attention and interoception, such as the parietal and insular cortices. In contrast, although there was no functional reorganization, socio-affective and socio-cognitive training produced distinct microstructural alterations in areas that are traditionally linked to interoceptive and emotional processing, such as the insular and orbitofrontal areas. Moreover, behavioral improvements in perspective-taking, compassion, and attentiveness were predicted by long-term changes in these structural und functional brain network organization. Notably, though we observed marked microstructural re-organization over the 9-month period of training, functional changes showed more dynamic alterations, suggesting more state-like influences of training on intrinsic function.

In this study, we therefore investigated the underlying predictive mechanisms of language processing under uncertainty as trait-markers for schizotypal and autistic traits. 55 participants assessed for schizotypal and autistic traits completed an auditory predictive language paradigm which modulates both the strength of semantic predictions as well as the reliability of the sensory input. To estimate the relative strength of semantic prior beliefs over the sensory input, we used a Bayesian belief updating model, to mechanistically quantify the prior weight, and investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings with EEG. While computational modelling revealed a global overweighting of prior beliefs relative to sensory information for increasing schizotypal traits only, EEG results indicated impaired processing of unpredictable input for both spectra on a neurophysiological level.

Experimental data aligning with the predictive coding account of psychosis suggests an imbalance between prior knowledge and sensory likelihood, where a favouring of sensory likelihood at lower levels, potentially linked to altered dopamine activity may lead to delusions, and an overreliance on prior beliefs at higher levels, possibly influenced by altered glutamatergic receptor signalling, may contribute to hallucinations.

In a longitudinal design, we examined 20 schizophrenia patients during acute psychosis and psychotic remission, with controls assessed in parallel. Participants completed a predictive language task involving sentences with varying predictability, ending in degraded final words with varying surprise; thus, probing expectation-induced hallucinations. A mechanistic Bayesian belief updating model was used to estimate the prior weights. Expectation-induced hallucinations and prior weights were compared across groups and time points. Findings indicate an overweighting of prior knowledge relative to sensory input in patients, notably pronounced during acute psychosis, coinciding with more expectation-induced hallucinations, which also correlated with stronger psychotic symptoms.

Etiologic explanations of the symptomatology include maladaptive changes in fatigue-associated fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical networks, particularly frontoparietal hypoactivity, as well as inflammation-related changes and impaired cortical blood flow regulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS] enhances cortical blood flow and modulates excitability of cortical areas. Repetitive application of anodal tDCS on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC] has been shown to improve fatigue in post-COVID patients. In the preset study, we investigated the effect of anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC on post COVID-related fatigue and fatigability 40 post-COVID-patients.

We compared three NF approaches for the motor cortex (MC) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy in 57 healthy participants regarding the underlying processes. In all groups, participants were able to regulate their MC activation, but without learning progress across sessions. FC-NF and single-region neurofeedback (SR-NF) resulted in a higher proportion of learning than SVM-NF. Regarding the underlying processes, no specific effects for the respective training parameters emerged from the different protocols (e.g., FC-NF members did not modulate connectivity but MC amplitude, similar to SR-NF members). In a pre-post motor task, reaction times decreased more in SR-NF and learners compared to non-learners. Accuracy increased after NF and was higher in NF learners. MC activation increased over time for learners and decreased for non-learners. Task load decreased over the sessions, but was higher in SVM-NF than in FC-NF. Motivation was higher among non-learners than among learners. In summary, SR-NF and FC-NF led to comparable results that were superior to the SVM-NF implemented here.

In this study of adults with remitted depression (rMDD), using two computational modeling approaches, we probed underlying decision-making processes to assess overall willingness to expend effort in rMDD and characterize latent decision strategies dependent on reward magnitude and probability. 108 participants, 40 unmedicated rMDD and 68 healthy controls, completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). In each trial, participants chose to complete an easy or a hard task as a function of reward magnitude and probability. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed that rMDDs demonstrated generally reduced willingness to expend effort, particularly for lower levels of reward magnitude and probability which reverted when reward was high and more likely. Similarly, Hierarchical Bayesian Drift Diffusion Modeling (HDDM) demonstrated a reduced tendency to accumulate evidence towards the high effort option but increased impact on drift-rate with high reward magnitude and probability in rMDD. Notably, subjective value modeling showed no group differences in decision-making strategies incorporating reward magnitude and probability information. Consistent with prior research, our findings suggest a persistent blunted reward sensitivity in rMDD. However, we observed increased sensitivity in rMDD when reward is high and more certain, indicative of persistent changes in the reward system promoting rMDD individuals to seek reward in more extreme conditions compensating for the diminished responsiveness to typical rewards.

First, in 59 patients with MDD and healthy control participants (HCPs), we replicate the previously reported invigorating effects of taVNS during the first session and reveal its generalizability to depression. Crucially, invigoration remained elevated in all participants, and patients with MDD showed persistent increases in wanting after taVNS in Session 1. Second, in 96 patients with MDD and HCPs, we show that symptoms of apathy and anhedonia, rather than depression itself, are linked to lower effort exertion and wanting, respectively. Higher fasting levels of ghrelin were associated with greater wanting, but this correspondence was attenuated by anhedonia. Third, HCPs (current N=18) received infusions of ghrelin, or saline during an instrumental motivation task using a double-blind crossover study during [11C] PET-fMRI. After ghrelin administration, participants\u2019 willingness to work for food versus monetary rewards increased, resulting in greater caloric payoff indicative of a shift in reward preference.

An alternative approach is to perform a mass univariate analysis along with cluster-based permutation testing. This approach is particularly helpful when there is little a priori knowledge about where and when the differences between conditions will be at their maximum. Here, we illustrate the advantages and pitfalls of this data-driven approach with two examples. First, event-related potential analysis is used to investigate an auditory discrimination task in which the topography of the effect size was not known a priori. Second, time-frequency analysis is used to detect electrophysiological indicators of the latent construct flexibility for the investigation of intraindividual differences. The potential of the mass univariate analysis approach for exploratory and hypothesis-driven research is discussed, while also looking at difficulties such as defining clusters and separating overlapping clusters, dealing with very large clusters that span many electrodes, frequencies, and time points, integrating results from ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests, or deciding on the appropriate permutation approach.

In this talk, Sven Lesche introduces a novel algorithm for ERP latency extraction based on template matching. The algorithm uses the grand average to generate a data-driven template of the component of interest and then matches that template to subject-level ERPs to recover the latency of the component in a given signal. In addition to a latency estimate, the algorithm provides a fit statistic for each subject-level ERP, indicating the degree of certainty the algorithm has in its decision. Preliminary results suggest that the template matching algorithm is able to recover simulated shifts in latency better than peak or area latency algorithms.

This led to higher-fidelity representations of WM content that were associated with improved behavior. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of WM, with frontal control managing maintenance of WM content in storage-related areas.

This symposium showcases several lines of research from intracranial recordings in humans that reveal the critical role of single-neuron activity in cognitive and executive functions. Our studies span the dynamic neural underpinnings of language comprehension, the processes underlying memory encoding and control, and the neural disruptions of motor and cognitive aspects in movement disorders. The first talk reveals how pronouns reactivate specific neuron representations of nouns, emphasizing a dynamic semantic memory network crucial for efficient language comprehension. The second presentation challenges a traditional view on the neural implementation of temporal order memory and provides a novel link between sequential memory and stimulus timing using recurrent neural network modeling. The third study explores the regulation of working memory through theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling, demonstrating how cognitive control and hippocampal single-neuron activity converge to enhance memory fidelity. The final talk uncovers the critical role of a cognitive-motor basal ganglia interface in locomotion control in Parkinson's disease.

FoG and Parkinsonian gait disorders, which worsen under cognitive load and heavily impair the quality of life, are thought to arise from abnormalities in basal ganglia-brainstem circuits, notably within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra (SN). Understanding STN and SN's roles in gait control is fundamental for developing new therapy approaches like combined STN+SN stimulation and closed-loop DBS. Twelve PD patients participated in this study involving a gait-like motor task during STN-DBS surgery. The task included a rest period, self-paced stepping, and stepping in response to random cues, with single-unit and network activities recorded across different movement phases. Results showed FoG-related changes in STN neurons, including increased irregularity and beta-band oscillatory behavior. SN neurons, in contrast, exhibited changes related only to the task's attentional demands. These findings highlight the roles of STN and SN neurons in both the motor and cognitive aspects of gait control. The research suggests that disruptions in neuronal firing patterns, which impede the integration of cognitive, emotional, and sensorimotor signals, play a role in FoG, highlighting the importance of the STN and SN as a cognitive-motor interface for smooth locomotion."}}}}, "session2-4": {"Index": "S09", "Talk": "The focused mind: neural signatures of selective attention in perception and memory", "Title": "S09 - The focused mind: neural signatures of selective attention in perception and memory", "DatePlace": "Donnerstag 09:00 - 10:30 | Ort TODO", "Chair": {"author": "Melinda Sabo ", "uni": "University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "Mantel": "Selective attention plays a crucial role in shaping both perception and memory.

Spontaneous fluctuations in the power of this rhythm are associated with the modulation of neuronal excitability and corresponding changes in perceptual decision-making. Shifts in its hemispheric distribution can be induced by instructional cues requiring selective attention or memorization of task-relevant information, or the selective inhibition of task-irrelevant or distracting information. While this effect is highly robust, recent studies have questioned whether alpha lateralization plays a causal role in distractor inhibition or is merely a by-product of other cue-related effects. In a first study, we investigated the role of alpha lateralization by leveraging the inhibition of return phenomenon, where attention is oriented away from an exogenously cued location. Interestingly, alpha lateralization reflected only attentional capture at the cued location but not the long-lasting attentional reorienting towards non-cued locations. Moreover, alpha lateralization was strongly correlated with the pattern of microsaccades. In our second study, we examined lateralization in a visual short-term memory task, in which participants made a lateral saccade during the memory delay interval to test in which spatial reference frame lateralization codes spatial information. We found that after the saccade, contralateral delay activity reflected memory representations coded in retinotopic coordinates, whereas alpha lateralization reflected a memory-unspecific screen center bias that was highly correlated with small shifts in gaze direction. Overall, these studies confirmed the link between alpha lateralization and cueing but also showed that the direction of lateralization can be decoupled from attentional orienting and memorization."}}, "38": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 2-4", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:30:00", "TalkEnd": "09:45:00", "Talk": "The focused mind: neural signatures of selective attention in perception and memory", "Speaker": "Philipp Deutsch", "Chair": "Melinda Sabo ", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Niko Busch, Philipp Deutsch, Melinda Sabo, Daniel Schneider, Sarah Tune, \n\nSelective attention plays a crucial role in shaping both perception and memory.

We investigated whether this finding extends to auditory working memory and the active processing of attended distractors. We asked participants to memorize the pitch of a target sound and to compare it with a probe sound presented after a 13-s memory delay period. In separate conditions, we compared a blank delay phase (no distraction) with either passive listening to, or active processing of, an auditory distractor presented throughout the memory delay. Consistent with previous reports, pitch-specific memory information could be decoded from fMRI signal patterns in auditory cortex during the delay in trials without distraction. In contrast, decoding of target sounds in auditory cortex dropped to chance level during both unattended and attended distraction. This was paralleled by memory performance decrements under distraction. Extending the analyses beyond auditory cortex yielded some evidence for memory content-specific activity in inferior frontal cortex during processing of attended distractors.

Here I present recent findings on the extent to which the time available for task resumption after an interruption can support these mechanisms. This was done using a visual working memory task that was randomly interrupted by an arithmetic task. After the interruption or no-interruption phase, a retro-cue indicated which of two stimulus orientations had to be reported. In no-interruption trials, the delay before retro-cue presentation was either short (2300ms) or long (3300ms). The interruption task had to be completed within 1800ms and was followed by either a short (500ms), long (1500ms) or self-paced (indicated by key press) resumption phase. While primary task accuracy (i.e., the precision of the orientation report) was reduced by a preceding interruption, it was not modulated by the time available in the resumption phase. However, primary task response times benefited from longer resumption phases, especially when the length of the resumption interval was self-paced. At the EEG level, theta oscillatory power (4-7Hz) at frontal sites and the suppression of posterior alpha power (8-14Hz) were used as correlates of attentional control processes after retro-cue presentation. Both theta power and alpha power suppression were reduced after an interruption, but the suppression of alpha power was also stronger with longer resumption phases.

First, subjects learnt associations between everyday objects and locations on the screen. Each object was associated with a task-relevant and an irrelevant location. The obtained alpha lateralization patterns supported the hypothesis that subjects selectively retrieved task-relevant information while inhibiting irrelevant items. Second, we investigated the role of attentional selection in LTM and its implications for goal-directed memory reactivation. The task required subjects to learn associations between an object and two locations on the screen. In the next phase, they were asked to retrieve one or both of the locations linked to an object, as indicated by a cue. In the selective cue condition, only one of the previous positions was relevant, while the neutral cue suggested that both positions remained relevant. In the final retrieval phase, subjects reported the learnt locations.

We hypothesised that high load reduces emotion effects during face processing and angry faces disrupt WM-processes by occupying shared cognitive resources. There were significant effects of load and emotion, but no simultaneous interaction in the source-space analyses. Spatiotemporal clusters starting 190 ms after face-onset revealed that angry faces elicited stronger activation in prefrontal and face-specific occipital areas, the insula, and anterior cingulate cortex during emotion discrimination. Insula activation was further correlated with later occipital reactivation, suggesting enhanced salience and processing for angry faces. When angry and happy faces were compared, a prefrontal cluster emerged 400 ms after face-onset, probably reflecting goal-directed control mechanisms required for angry faces. In gaze-related and behavioural analyses, we observed a positivity bias with processing advantages for positive faces. In the high-load n-back, alpha and beta power was reduced in parieto- and temporo-occipital regions and cingulate cortex, indicating reduced distractor inhibition and WM-processes.

Our results highlight extensive frequency-specific information exchange between IFG subdivisions and long-range inter-areal top-down modulations of posterior areas, explaining the behavioral interference effects.

In our three studies, we found that 45% to 63% percentage of participants chose to reapply the strategy that was less effortful. Empirical evidence in the implementation phase underscores the necessity of cognitive effort in ER, as indicated by subjective reports and physiological markers.

In rats, we first examined how oral administration of CBD influences simple and cumulative memory processing with the Object Space Task. In the next step, we conducted acute and chronic electrophysiological recordings from the prelimbic cortex and hippocampus after administration of CBD to look at its influence on sleep states and offline markers of consolidation in more detail. Behaviourally, we show that CBD leads to worse cumulative memories while the simple memories stay intact. When looking at its influence on sleep dynamics, CBD overall extended NREM sleep, however changing the properties of delta, spindle and ripples in the process. Specifically, we noticed that CBD administration led to a targeted reduction of long ripples which we later confirmed with acute recordings to be intrahippocampal ripples with CA3 as input. The short ripples, on the other hand, which were later identified as more cortical induced ripples remained intact. Overall, to sum up the findings, we propose the reduction of long ripples to be a potential mechanism explaining the CBD induced deficit in cumulative memory processing.

Recent evidence has shown that ripples are not confined to the hippocampus, but rather constitute a widespread neocortical phenomenon. To date, it remains unclear whether hippocampal and neocortical ripples are morphologically similar. Crucially, the functional role of neocortical ripples remains undetermined. In this study, we conducted intracranial recordings in patients with epilepsy from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortex during sleep. Results indicate a consistent ripple morphology across regions, and reveal region-specific functional specializations. MTL ripples facilitate directional information flow from the MTL to neocortex, thus promoting synchronization of the memory network. Conversely, neocortical ripples impede this information flow, potentially minimizing interference with local processing. At the population level, MTL ripples restrict population dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace, whereas neocortical ripples lead to more diverse and higher-dimensional population responses. This differentiation may constitute the mechanism that functionally uncouples the MTL-neocortical network. Importantly, the key findings were replicated in rodents, wherein the same division-of-labor between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was observed.

Critically, although SWRs are precisely coupled to the cardinal NREM sleep-related mesoscopic brain rhythms (i.e., cortical slow oscillations and thalamocortical spindles), evidence for a link between SWRs and directed information transfer is scarce. Here, we leveraged the rare opportunity of nocturnal single-unit and LFP recordings in neurosurgical patients to uncover the SWR-triggered information flow by tracking the impact of SWRs on single-neuron activity along the hippocampal output network, including entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex. We recorded 1433 neurons during 40 night sessions in 17 epilepsy patients implanted with hybrid macro-micro electrodes for presurgical diagnostics. Preliminary results indicate a consistent pattern of temporally precise increases in neuronal firing rate (FR) synchronized with hippocampal SWRs. Importantly, FR increases were not confined to local hippocampal neurons but also became apparent in single neurons in distant, downstream regions, suggesting an interregional impact of SWRs. The temporal delay along the hippocampal-neocortical pathway suggests a causal directionality, with the hippocampus as the driving hub. Our results support the idea of a causal relationship between SWRs and hippocampal-neocortical information transmission during sleep.

Therefore, we extensively characterized Magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting-state data (n = 350, ages 18-88) derived from the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience using approximately 6000 features. Employing conventional and novel features extracted from the highly comparative time-series analysis toolbox (Fulcher et al., 2017), we used partial least squares regression and cross-validation techniques to predict individual age. Our findings demonstrate low to good prediction accuracies for conventional features (amplitude- and phase-coupling, (aperiodic-adjusted) power, alpha peak measures), ranging from r = 0.17 to r = 0.65, with the best performances observed for measures reflecting alpha peak frequency. Remarkably, we found that over a hundred novel features outperformed conventional metrics in predictive power, with notable improvements by the autocorrelation function (r = 0.75, mean absolute error = 10.3 y, lag = 36 ms). We observed increased autocorrelation, that is, self-similarity of the MEG signal, in the visual cortex in old age and, conversely, a decrease in temporal areas compared to younger individuals.

While we observed age-related differences in brain signal variability obtained with rs-fMRI and rs-EEG, surprisingly, the two measures showed no significant correlation; instead, they seemed to provide complementary information on the state of the aging brain. Following this, I will discuss about the mechanism by which brain structure (e.g., white matter hyperintensity) may influence age-dependent oscillatory changes (e.g., alpha peak frequency) assessed by EEG (N=907).

Differences in the ability to extinguish conditioned fear are typically inferred by comparing the means of patients and healthy control groups over the entire time course of the experiment. Here, we introduce an exploratory analysis using an innovative event-related approach. In the nationwide research network for exposure therapy (PROTECT-AD), n = 267 patients with diverse anxiety disorders and n = 84 healthy controls were investigated during a two-day differential fear extinction paradigm. Fear conditioned and extinguished responses were measured per trial through threat expectancy ratings, fear-potentiated startle, and skin conductance response. We identified trials per subject that indicated important hallmarks of threat expectancy change for the conditioned cue (CS+) during extinction training (e.g., trial with rating of zero, individual lowest value or maximum relative change) and analysed the multi-modal responses before and after those 'events'. Preliminary analyses revealed a steeper decline in threat expectancy directly preceding the events and a greater rebound afterwards for patients, compared to controls. Additionally, patients showed an increase of the startle response during the event trial, suggesting differences in the timing of the subcortical defensive response activation in comparison with controls.

In this study, we aimed to investigate extinction generalization by promoting the updating of extinction memory through mental imagery of the experienced inhibitory association with novel, semantically similar stimuli. To date, 15 participants underwent a three-day, within-subject, category-based fear conditioning paradigm. Two conditioned stimulus (CS) categories were paired with an electric shock during acquisition training (CSa+; CSb+), while one CS category was not (CS-). On day two, extinction training was followed by a prompt to retrieve the inhibitory learning association and to imagine the same experience with novel stimuli for the CSa+ category. On day three, participants were tested for extinction generalization, including elements seen during acquisition and extinction training, as well as new or the vividly imagined elements. Preliminary data indicate reduced return of fear for stimuli imagined during extinction memory updating compared to novel stimuli of the same (CSa+) or other categories (CSb+), as evidenced by reduced skin conductance response and fear-potentiated startle.

Formalized as defense cascade model, it was shown that an approaching inevitable threat (e.g., electric shock) elicits a state of parasympathetically-dominated attentive immobility, marked by increasing cardiac deceleration and skin conductance (post-encounter defense). However, if the threat is most imminent and can be actively avoided (circa-strike), the organism is under growing sympathetic control, indicated by cardiac acceleration and even more increased skin conductance. Here, we tested whether similar dynamics of autonomic defensive responding are also observed in the context of social threat. Forty-one healthy participants underwent a novel social defense cascade paradigm, in which increasing social threat imminence was operationalized by pictures of neutral faces, that gradually changed to full-blown angry expressions accompanied by auditory negative devaluations. In half of the trials participants had the option to actively avoid the auditory social threat, while in the other half social threat was inevitable. In line with prior research using electric shocks, we found that cardiac deceleration defined the defensive response pattern when participants were exposed to approaching inevitable social threat, switching to acceleration when threat was avoidable and most imminent. Contrasting previous research, however, we found that skin conductance decreased when approaching social threat was inevitable and only increased when participants had the option to avoid. These results suggest that dynamic defensive responding to approaching threat can generally be translated to the social domain, however also point to specific response patterns."}}, "59": {"Tag": "Donnerstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 3-3", "SessionStart": "16:30:00", "SessionEnd": "18:00:00", "TalkStart": "17:30:00", "TalkEnd": "17:45:00", "Talk": "Exploring emotional dynamics: Physiological and subjective insights from clinical and experimental perspectives\u00a0", "Speaker": "Yunbo Yang ", "Chair": " Janine Wirkner, Maike Hollandt", "Inhalt": "Autor Janine Wirkner, Co-Autor: Maike Hollandt\n\nIn this symposium, we explore research on threat reactivity, fear extinction, and emotion regulation, providing valuable insights from both clinical and experimental perspectives to enhance our understanding of the complex biopsychosocial factors associated with mental disorders.\nThe first contribution investigates threat reactivity in patients with primary anxiety or depressive disorders within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.

Here we test the limits of such simultaneity by manipulating attention towards sensory distractors during a working memory task performed by human subjects during fMRI scanning. Participants remembered the orientation of a target grating while a distractor grating was shown during the middle portion of the memory delay. Critically, there were several subtle changes in the contrast and the orientation of the distractor, and participants were cued to either ignore the distractor, detect a change in contrast, or detect a change in orientation. Despite sensory stimulation being matched in all three conditions, the fidelity of memory representations in early visual cortex was highest when the distractor was ignored, intermediate when participants attended distractor contrast, and lowest when participants attended the orientation of the distractor during the delay. In contrast, the fidelity of distractor representations was lowest when ignoring the distractor, intermediate when attending distractor-contrast, and highest when attending distractor-orientation.

This limited capacity is likely the result of (1) the allocation of working memory items to different stores, (2) interference within and between these regions, and (3) the region-inherent forms of neural codes used to retain features. Here, we demonstrate that different cortical regions fulfil independent representational roles during working memory by investigating how load affects working memory storage in different cortical regions. In each trial, participants (n = 81, average age = 25) had to memorize two sequentially presented items, either two visual items, two auditory items or one of each. Crucially, this means that overall working memory load was constant at two items, but visual load varied between one and two items. We analyzed fMRI data using support vector machine regression to continuously reconstruct memorized orientations throughout the delay period. In visual cortex (but not anterior regions), we observed a decreased decoding accuracy with increased visual working memory load. We further find an increase in information for more recent items in FEF, but not in visual cortex. Consistently, memory recall performance was better at lower loads and when a more recent item was recalled. Information in all three regions correlated with behavioral performance.

In particular, both attention and selection were encoded by the same population of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Do these neurons form neural ensembles synchronizing with each other to represent the relevant cue? To answer this question we analyzed the local field potentials recorded while two rhesus macaques performed WM and attention tasks. On WM trials, the monkeys remembered the colors of two squares. After a memory delay, a cue indicated whether to report the color of the \u2018upper\u2019 or \u2018lower\u2019 square. After a second memory delay, the monkeys reported the cued color. Attention trials were identical to WM trials, except that the cue was presented before the colored squares. First, we found 157 pairs of electrodes (~7.5%) were selectively synchronized when attending to the upper or lower location; 323 electrode pairs (~15.5%) were synchronized when selecting an upper or lower item from WM. Second, we found that a significant number of electrode pairs maintained their location preference in both tasks. Third, we found this preference generalized across cues in PFC.

This can be used strategically when searching for an object; visual input that resembles the content of working memory is favored by the visual system over visual input that does not. Memory-driven search requires visual processing regions to actively maintain a visual representation of the target object, while simultaneously processing novel visual input (i.e., the scene). But how should the object be represented? Visual objects produce very different retinal images depending on where they are in the scene. The color of the retinal image, for instance, depends on the illumination, and its size can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the viewing distance. Accordingly, the current visual input (i.e., the search location) might also determine the nature of the memory representation, because \u2013 in order to benefit search \u2013 memory representations need to account for contextual dependencies. Here, we measured fMRI BOLD activity in human observers while they prepared to search for objects at different distances in indoor scene photographs. First, we established that observers instantiated visual memory representations of the target object in object-selective cortex during search preparation (while no object was presented). Second, we demonstrated that these visual object representations were scaled to account for viewing distance: activity patterns reflected smaller object representations during distant search, and larger object representations during nearby search.

However, these nasal sprays actually contained either capsaicin to induce a mild burning sensation or saline. After initial testing, participants were then randomized into two groups, one continuing to believe the nasal sprays contained pain relief medication while the other was informed otherwise, allowing for independent manipulation of side effects and pain relief expectations. Findings reveal that nasal sprays with side effects result in lower perceived pain compared to inert sprays without side effects. The influence of side effects on pain perception depends upon individual beliefs about the relationship of side effects and treatment effectiveness and upon expectations regarding treatment received. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data implicate the involvement of the descending pain modulatory system, including the anterior cingulate cortex and the periaqueductal gray, in mediating the effects of side effects on pain perception. Overall, these results indicate that mild side effects can signal effective treatment, thereby influencing treatment expectations and outcomes through the descending pain modulatory system.

Therefore, we investigated the differences of somatic and visceral pain in a nocebo paradigm and from a translational perspective by modeling the experience of fluctuating pain of different modalities as commonly experienced by patients.

MR-informed EEG analysis indicated a temporal sequence of common effects during the anticipation phase starting with the DLPFC, going on to the anterior insula, and concluding with the ACC near pain onset. In conclusion, expectations and pain perception could be reliably manipulated using a sham-BCI.

However, neural degeneration per se is not matched by unremitting declines in cognitive abilities. Instead, middle-aged and older adults typically maintain surprisingly high levels of cognitive functioning, suggesting that the human brain can adapt to structural degeneration by neural compensation. In this talk, I will summarize prevailing theories and recent empirical studies on neural compensation with a focus on often neglected contributing factors, such as lifestyle, metabolism, and neural plasticity. Research suggests that these factors moderate the relationship between structural integrity and neural compensation, maintaining psychological well-being and behavioural functioning. Possibly, a breakdown in neural compensation may pose a tipping point that distinguishes the trajectories of healthy vs. pathological ageing, but conjoint support from psychology and cognitive neuroscience for this alluring view is still scarce. Therefore, future experiments that target the concomitant processes of neural compensation and associated behaviour will foster a comprehensive understanding of both healthy and pathological ageing."}}, "71": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-1", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:15:00", "TalkEnd": "09:30:00", "Talk": "Multidisciplinary and multimodal perspectives on episodic memory in neuropsychiatric disorders", "Speaker": "Thomas P.

Flexible retrieval can be operationalized by transitive inference paradigms, which require participants to infer hierarchical relationships between novel combinations of elements (e.g., B>D) based on knowledge formed in distinct learning episodes involving these elements in different contexts (e.g. A>B, B>C, C>D). A hypothesized mechanism enabling transitive inference is the widening of tuning of individual hippocampal neurons from responding to one element (B) prior to learning to responding to further, related elements (B and D) after learning. A rare opportunity to obtain decisive data on this hypothesis is given in chronic intracranial seizure monitoring in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with the primary aim to detect seizure onset zones for later surgical removal. Using data from 18 such patients while they performed a transitive inference task, we find evidence against persistent widening of tuning curves of individual neurons that initially responded to only one of the elements in the task. Unexpectedly, we find a group of neurons that did not respond to any stimuli involved in the task prior to learning but start responding specifically to combinations of elements (A>B; but not B> C) after learning. These neurons are found only in patients successfully performing transitive inference. These preliminary findings suggest a potentially novel single neuron mechanism enabling flexible expression of episodic memory in the case of transitive interference."}}, "72": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-1", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:30:00", "TalkEnd": "09:45:00", "Talk": "Multidisciplinary and multimodal perspectives on episodic memory in neuropsychiatric disorders", "Speaker": "Angelica Staniloiu", "Chair": "Jessica Peter, Michael Orth ", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Jessica Peter, Michael Orth \n\nThe ability to form and retrieve memories about personal experiences is paramount for human existence.

Both static and functional brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography [PET], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) was performed, when available.

An abrupt loss of both memory for past experiences and personal identity is highly indicative of dissociative amnesia; anterograde or retrograde circumscribed dissociative amnesias can also occur.

Here, we utilized the trauma film paradigm along with pattern similarity analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to explore how trauma-analogue experiences are represented in the brain and how these representations are reactivated during memory intrusions. Participants viewed film clips depicting traumatic content as well as content-matched neutral scenes while undergoing fMRI scans. Subsequently, they reported instances of involuntary memory intrusions during a period of rest. Encoding of trauma-analog experiences was associated with higher activity in wide-spread visual areas and salience network but lower activation in superior temporal cortex compared to neutral events. Enhanced neural processing in visual areas, but not in superior temporal cortex, predicted the number of memory intrusions across participants. Using pattern similarity analyses, we observed that neural representations of trauma-analog experiences were more similar in visual areas, while trauma-analog representations in superior temporal cortex were more distinct compared to neural representations of neutral events. Prior to memory intrusions, pattern similarity in visual areas again increased between different memory intrusions suggesting trauma-unspecific visual representations. At the same time, memory intrusions reactivated specific neural representations of that same episode in anterior cingulate cortex. Our results suggest simultaneous involvement of multiple representational formats with different characteristics of specificity and similarity in visual areas and the anterior cingulate cortex during memory intrusions. Linking these characteristics to trauma memory phenomena, e.g., cue generalization, in the future may help unravel the neural pathway of memory intrusions."}}, "74": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-1", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "10:00:00", "TalkEnd": "10:15:00", "Talk": "Multidisciplinary and multimodal perspectives on episodic memory in neuropsychiatric disorders", "Speaker": "Michael Orth", "Chair": "Jessica Peter, Michael Orth ", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Jessica Peter, Michael Orth \n\nThe ability to form and retrieve memories about personal experiences is paramount for human existence.

Five minutes after encoding, a surprising free recall of the words followed. In both groups, modulation of the left DLPFC enhanced overall recall (p=.042). Recall of positive content increased as total number of positive words (p<.001) and in relation to overall recall (10-15%; p<.001).

Prior research suggests these levels of representation mutually inform one another, such that phonetic features are encoded until lexical identity is resolved (Gwilliams et al., 2022). The same work also revealed that the word-initial phoneme\u2019s features are pre-activated, suggesting that lexical prediction manifests in first phoneme pre-activation. Here, we investigate whether this flexibility in phonetic encoding is impaired in people with aphasia, and whether it explains their language deficit. We recorded EEG data during natural story listening in 24 healthy participants and 39 participants with aphasia. We applied time-resolved decoding of phonetic features from the EEG signals and found a significant group difference: phonetic features were decodable significantly longer in the control than in the aphasia group. Next, we will decode phonetic features as a function of low and high lexical entropy, i.e., a measure of uncertainty about word identity given the current phonemic input. We hypothesize that people with aphasia show a weaker relation between phoneme decoding time and lexical uncertainty compared to controls, indicating a weaker connection between these levels of representation. Finally, we will decode phonetic features for each phoneme position within a word separately. We hypothesize that people with aphasia will show less pre-activation of the first phoneme\u2018s features as a result of lexical prediction than controls.

Specifically, we asked how increased cognitive load affects language prediction on different time scales, ranging from words to paragraphs, and how this might be modulated by age. A total of 174 participants (18-85 years; tested online or in the lab) performed a self-paced reading paradigm by reading short newspaper articles presented word-by-word in various font colors. The task was either performed in isolation or paired with a competing n-back task on the words' font color. To quantify word predictability, we generated surprisal scores on four distinct timescales (i.e., context lengths) for each word using GPT-2. We analyzed word-level reading times, block-level reading comprehension, and n-back task performance. Our results revealed that higher cognitive demands diminished the positive effects of word predictability on reading speed, suggesting that the formation of surprisal draws on resources of cognitive control.

Approaching this issue from a naturalistic perspective, we investigated whether language comprehension is best accounted for by a predictive or an integratory parsing mechanism. Participants listened to Dutch audiobook stories while their brain activity was measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Each word in the audiobook was assigned a complexity metric that reflects the amount of structure built by the two parsers when incorporating that word into the syntactic structure of the sentence. These syntactic features were then mapped onto MEG source activity using multivariate temporal response functions (TRFs), which are linear kernels that describe how the brain responds to a representation of a (linguistic) feature. By including lower-level features as predictors in our TRF models, we explicitly modeled the acoustic (i.e., acoustic spectrogram, acoustic onsets) and statistical (i.e., word frequency, entropy, surprisal) properties of the stimuli. The results show that both syntactic features explain unique variance in the left-hemispheric language network, and that both have a distinct temporal response function. The effects were strongest for the predictive feature, showing that, during naturalistic comprehension, syntactic structures can be built in a predictive manner. Moreover, the combination of strong predictive effects and weak integratory effects suggests that successful predictive processing reduces demands on integratory processing.

In addition to several unfavorable medical conditions, these individuals also report higher levels of loneliness and less benefits from social interaction. Bariatric surgery is one treatment option to induce large weight loss, which is associated with improvements in overall somatic health. However, it is not well-understood yet if and how subjective feelings of loneliness and enjoyment of being with others change after weight loss. The endocannabinoid system could serve as a biological marker to assess the hypothesized changes in subjective experiences of social interactions and well-being following bariatric surgery. This would provide a mechanistic perspective on patients\u2019 daily life experiences. The current non-randomized clinical trial will recruit at least 113 individuals undergoing different types of bariatric surgery. Patients are invited to the laboratory three times: a baseline assessment 4 weeks prior to surgery, a short-term follow-up 6 weeks after surgery, and a long-term follow-up approx. 1 year after surgery. Endocannabinoid concentrations (anandamide [AEA] and 2-arachidonoyglycerol [2-AG] and lipids such as oleoylethanolamide [OEA] and palmitoylethanolamide [PEA]) will be assessed in hair samples at each measurement time point, as will be self-reported well-being and enjoyment of social interactions. Moreover, experimental tasks targeting social experience facets will be administered. We hypothesize that endocannabinoid concentrations will be lower one year after the surgery than before, and that this reduction will be related to changes in subjective experience of social interactions and well-being, but also to weight loss.

A new perspective on the predictive potential of deviations from structured auditory regularities.", "body": "The auditory system has an amazing ability to rapidly encode auditory regularities. Evidence comes from the popular oddball paradigm, in which frequent (standard) sounds are occasionally exchanged for rare (deviant) sounds, which then elicit signs of prediction error based on their unexpectedness (e.g., MMN, P3a, decline in performance). Here, we examine the widely neglected characteristics of deviants being bearers of predictive information themselves. Naive participants listened to sound sequences constructed according to a new, modified version of the oddball paradigm including two types of deviants that followed diametrically opposed rules: one deviant sound occurred mostly in pairs (repetition rule), the other deviant sound occurred mostly in isolation (non-repetition rule). Due to this manipulation, the sound following a first deviant (either the same deviant or a standard) was either predictable or unpredictable based on its conditional probability associated with the preceding deviant sound. The response times and false alarm rates in an active deviant detection task show that deviant repetition rules (based on conditional probability) can be extracted when behaviourally relevant. The electrophysiological findings obtained in a passive listening setting indicate that conditional probability also translates into differential processing at the P3a level. However, MMN was confined to global deviants and was not sensitive to conditional probability. This suggests that higher-level processing (reflected in P3a and behaviour) but not lower-level sensory processing (reflected in MMN) is affected by rarely encountered rules."}}, "85": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 4-4", "SessionStart": "16:30:00", "SessionEnd": "18:00:00", "TalkStart": "17:00:00", "TalkEnd": "17:15:00", "Talk": "Models of Mismatch Responses - Moderators and Underlying Mechanisms", "Speaker": "Insa Schlossmacher", "Chair": "Insa Schlossmacher", "Inhalt": "Autor Insa Schlossmacher, \n\nPerceiving unexpected events is an important function of human perception and of utmost importance for survival.

Unexpected visual events compared to expected events are usually accompanied by a stronger neural response that can be measured by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response as well as electroencephalography. These deviance responses have been proposed to rely on different mechanisms, including prediction error-related activity and fatigue-based mechanisms. Whether these mechanisms vary systematically between early and late responses or different cortical areas is yet unknown. One way to delineate the contribution of these two mechanisms to deviance effects is to compare the responses of deviant and standard stimuli to a control stimulus. In the current study, we recorded EEG-fMRI while participants (N = 54) viewed a visual oddball sequence as well as a suited control condition. Comparing activation to deviants and standards, we found a visual mismatch negativity as well as a P3 in the EEG, while we found uncovered activations in occipital cortex (OC) and superior parietal lobe (SPL) in the fMRI. While mismatch response in the EEG and posterior OC were predominantly driven by fatigue-based mechanisms, responses in anterior OC and SPL could be best explained by predictive processing.

We combined average-based approaches with single-trial computational modeling (study 1) and PPI-connectivity (study 2) to shed light on mismatch processing in the multi-sensory brain. Across sensory modalities we identified highly comparable response profiles of modality specific early signatures (MMN) as well as modality general late responses (P3). In addition to parametric dependence of MMRs on the number of stimulus repetitions, strikingly, we found sensitivity to cross-modal probabilistic dependencies, particularly at later latencies (P3) and within modality general hubs of the extended mismatch network (IPS).

In 2 out of 4 encoding blocks, we presented entirely uninformative stimuli between the predictive stimulus and the outcome (i.e. potential PE). Memory was tested in a recognition test 24h later. Our data replicated the enhancing effects of aversive (signed) PEs on memory recognition that even go beyond arousal-related effects on memory formation. The PE-effect was specific to the predictive stimuli and not observed for uninformative stimuli presented between the predictive stimulus and the outcome. The mere presence of uninformative stimuli was shown to even abolish this PE-driven memory enhancement suggesting that PEs are sensitive to interference and may point to an involvement of working memory.

Childhood maltreatment mediated a portion of the effect of family history on depression, particularly in subjects with parental depression onset before the age of 40, with abuse showing stronger associations and higher mediation proportions than neglect.

State-of-the-art brain imaging processing protocols were applied, encompassing the extraction of grey and white matter volume, cortical thickness, white matter lesions, and functional connectivity metrics. Preliminary findings indicated high comparability across study centers with age-dependent decreases of grey matter volume, increases in cerebrospinal fluid and generally larger brain volumes in males. For white matter volume, these trends seemed to be non-linear. Furthermore, we found heterogeneous brain-behavior associations across cognitive domains. All associations were marked by high inter-individual variance. Finally, the data has been effectively utilized in a newly developed deep learning-based brain-age model. Commonly studied imaging biomarkers align with established theories of (cognitive) brain aging and sex differences, exhibiting high consistency across MR study sites.

This offers rich opportunity for the brain to exploit this structure for efficient ways to code and process information, e.g., by making and testing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Several theories suggest that making and testing predictions is implemented through top-down effects within cortical processing hierarchies. But how do such top-down effects affect neural processing in their respective target areas? I will propose that top-down predictions increase the separability of neural activity patterns in these areas. In support of this hypothesis, I will present data that show how predictions affect the separability of neural activity patterns in the macaque face-processing system, a 3-level processing hierarchy in the superior temporal sulcus. In particular, we find that in the presence of predictions, early stages of this hierarchy exhibit well separable and high-dimensional neural geometries otherwise characteristic only of the top of the hierarchy. This is accompanied by a systematic shift of tuning properties from higher to lower areas, endowing lower areas with higher-order, invariant representations instead of their feedforward tuning properties. Thus, top-down predictions dynamically transform neural representations of faces into separable and high-dimensional neural geometries. These results provide evidence how predictive context transforms flexible representational spaces to optimally use the computational resources provided by cortical processing hierarchies for better and faster distinction of visual inputs."}}, "93": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 5-1", "SessionStart": "11", "SessionEnd": "12:30:00", "TalkStart": "11:15:00", "TalkEnd": "11:30:00", "Talk": "Unravelling Visual Prediction: Insights from Electrophysiology, EEG, fMRI, and Computational Modelling", "Speaker": "Annika Garlichs", "Chair": "Helen Blank", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Arjen Alink, Wanlu Fu, Annika Garlichs, Lea-Maria Schmitt, Caspar Schwiedrzik, Co-Autoren: Janika Becker, Helen Blank, Benjamin Gagl, Floris de Lange, \n\nThe central role of predictions in visual perception prompts ongoing debates regarding how priors influence sensory processing, specifically whether, where, and when they increase or reduce representations of expected input.

The integration of prior and sensory information can manifest through distinct underlying computational mechanisms: focusing on unexpected input, denoted as prediction error (PE) processing, or amplifying anticipated information via sharpened representation. In this preregistered study, we employed computational modelling using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) combined with representational similarity analyses of fMRI data to investigate these two processes during face perception. We compared the representational dissimilarities of our neural data to hypothesized dissimilarities based on activations of a DCNN trained in face recognition (VGG-Face) as well as two object-trained DCNNs (VGG-16, ResNet50). Participants (N = 43) were cued to see face images, some generated by morphing two faces, leading to ambiguity in face identity. Expected faces were identified faster and perception of ambiguous faces was shifted towards the expected identity. Consistently across DCNNs, multivariate analyses uncovered evidence for PE processing across the face-processing hierarchy from the occipital face area (OFA), via the fusiform face area, to the anterior temporal lobe, and beyond in parietal and frontal regions. Representational dissimilarities based on VGG-Face further suggested sharpened representations in the OFA.

How the human brain accomplishes this, however, remains an open question. In particular, it is unclear whether such integration enhances or reduces the neural encoding of expected stimuli, as postulated by the Bayesian brain theory and predictive coding respectively. To investigate this, we conducted an electroencephalography experiment aimed at measuring the relative encoding strength of expected and unexpected image components over time, using multivariate analysis of event-related potential (ERP) patterns across all electrodes. During the experiment, we presented repetitive predictable sequences of natural images while occasionally presenting an image overlay composed of the currently expected and an unexpected image (the expected and unexpected component respectively). ERP patterns evoked by natural images revealed robust information about image identity. Intriguingly, this identity information emerged already shortly before image onset (-200ms), which could reflect active anticipatory processes, i.e. the encoding of perceptual priors. Moreover, we found that ERP patterns evoked by the overlay images revealed increased stimulus identity encoding for expected image components during the early time window (120-160ms) while unexpected image component identity was more strongly encoded during a later time window (200-240ms).

Based on a transparent neurocognitive model, we postulated that readers optimize their percept by removing redundant visual signals, which allows them to focus on the informative aspects of the sensory input, i.e., the orthographic prediction error (oPE). Here, we test alternative oPE implementations by assuming all-or-nothing signaling units based on multiple thresholds and compare them to the original oPE implementation. For model evaluation, we implemented the comparison based on behavioral and electrophysiological data (EEG at 230, 430 ms). We found the highest model fit for the oPE with a 50% threshold integrating multiple prediction units for behavior and the late EEG component. The early EEG component was still explained best by the original hypothesis. In the final evaluation, we used image representations of both oPE implementations as input to a deep-neuronal network model (DNN). We compared the lexical decision performance of the DNN in two tasks (words vs. consonant strings; words vs. pseudowords) to the performance after training with unaltered word images and found better DNN performance when trained with the 50% oPE representations in both tasks.

Brain activation during mental arithmetic was measured in younger (18-35 years; N = 62) and older adults (above 60 years; N = 29), using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Arithmetic complexity was manipulated by the carry and borrow operations in two-digit addition and subtraction. The behavioral results indicate that only the carry effect decreases during aging. The neural activation pattern for arithmetic changes during aging with older adults showing more frontal activation as compared to younger adults. This suggests that older adults are more automatized in arithmetic operations and use domain-general resources to process complex arithmetic efficiently.

General cognitive impairment is frequent in PD ranging from mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) to dementia, reflected by difficulties in everyday function. Despite its importance for everyday function, there is a lack of systematic research on basic numerical cognition and arithmetic in PD. Therefore, the current project compares performance in basic numerical cognition and arithmetic between PD patients (n = 79) with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), with normal cognition (PD-NC), and healthy elderly (HC, n = 40). Additionally, the association with activities of daily living is analysed. Participants went through comprehensive numerical (transcoding, number line estimation, non-symbolic and symbolic magnitude comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, numerical activities of daily living) and neuropsychological test batteries, sociodemographic and clinical questionnaires. Controlling for confounders, groups differ in some tasks (i.e., (non-)symbolic magnitude comparison, arithmetic), but not in others (i.e., transcoding, number line estimation). This differential picture suggests that PD leads to specific impairments in numerical cognition, going beyond domain-general cognitive deficits. While some mechanisms seem to be affected by early Parkinsonian deficits, most impairments only occur at the PD-MCI stage, which can be explained with neurocognitive models of numerical cognition.

Dysfunction or structural changes in the hippocampus have been linked to challenges in emotion regulation, decreased stress resilience and increased risk for depression and anxiety disorders. Understanding the impact of emotion regulation and estrogen on hippocampal volume thus provides valuable insights into mental health and emotional well-being. In order to disentangle the effects of estrogen and other gonadal hormones like progesterone or testosterone on neural plasticity we pharmacologically increased estradiol levels in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded design in young women in their early follicular menstrual cycle phase when gonadal hormone levels are low. Our preliminary data shows that the rapid increase of estrogen impacts bilateral parahippocampus volume. Furthermore, emotion regulation traits appear to be associated with right hippocampus volume.

In addition to traditional mean-based analyses to assess the effects of OC initiation and discontinuation, we employed inter-subject representational similarity analyses (IS-RSA) to explore connections between interindividual patterns of variability in hormone concentrations, parcelwise resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), and mood. The results indicated a significant reduction in depressive symptom scores following OC discontinuation. While no direct associations were found between changes in depressive symptoms and gonadal hormone concentrations or functional brain architecture, alterations in progestogen (progesterone and progestin) levels were generally linked with changes in RSFC in frontal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions. Notably, RSFC patterns in the superior frontal gyrus were associated with progestogen concentrations and changes in positive mood. Overall, women experiencing adverse mood effects may be more inclined to discontinue OC use, potentially leading to their underrepresentation in scientific studies. Although no direct neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying changes in depressive symptoms were identified, concentrations of progestogens, rather than estrogens, were associated with alterations in brain functional architecture in regions relevant for mental health."}}, "106": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia Session 5-3", "SessionStart": "11", "SessionEnd": "12:30:00", "TalkStart": "12:00:00", "TalkEnd": "12:15:00", "Talk": "The Brain on Gonadal Hormones: Uncovering the Interplay between Affect and Brain Dynamics", "Speaker": "Arielle Crestol", "Chair": "Anna Denninger", "Inhalt": "Autor Anna Denninger\n\nGonadal hormones, integral to the reproductive system in both sexes, appear to play a critical role in our everyday life regulating various physiological and psychological responses within the body and influencing our affective system including the stress response, emotion regulation, reward processing and mood. As the brain represents a gateway for endocrine effects, their influence further extends to brain structure and functioning. Any alterations in the hormone levels may lead to health challenges. Women, especially, experience hormonal fluctuation throughout their lifespan that impact brain function and plasticity, affect regulation, and mental well-being. Thus, changes in hormonal status (e.g., menstrual cycle fluctuations, use of hormonal contraceptives, and menopause) have been linked to mental health and brain architecture changes in different groups of women.

Surgical menopause and longer natural reproductive span were associated with longer LTL. The greatest variance was explained by models including the addition of both depression and APOE \u03b54 genotype.

A group of N = 35 neurological patients (age: M = 47.34, SD = 14.36) with diverse functional deficits engaged in the imVMT, learning to encode and reconstruct spatial arrangements of everyday objects on a virtual table through gesture-based interactions. Spatial memory was evaluated by comparing task performance with conventional neuropsychological assessments. Additionally, ten participants (age: M = 48.72, SD = 13.55) with spatial memory impairments underwent a five-session training, acquiring mnemonic strategies within VR, complemented by immediate visual feedback on their performance. Our findings reveal significant correlations between imVMT outcomes and established measures of spatial memory, global cognition, visuomotor processing, and visual attention. Participants rated the VR task highly for its user-friendliness and lack of discomfort (diagnostic task), despite a slight increase in VR-induced symptoms over multiple sessions (training task). The training group demonstrated improvements in spatial memory performance. As immersive VR applications are increasingly applied in clinical settings, the identification of appropriate parameters for cognitive processes is crucial.

To unravel the differences in retrieval of VR-based and PC-based engrams on the electrophysiological level, we investigated the neural correlates of retrieval processes underlying both in an initial study. After incidental encoding of photorealistic scenes either in VR or on a screen, we replicated the well-established theta old/new effect for the PC-condition, but remarkably, not for the VR-condition. As thetaband increases are related to top-down control on, and memory load during retrieval, the observed effect relates VR-engrams to less effortful retrieval compared to PC-engrams. The analysis of gammaband oscillations would allow for the precise differentiation of the underlying retrieval processes, complementing findings from the low-frequency range. However, 30-100Hz activity is particularly prone to electrical and extracerebral artefacts, impeding undisturbed signal acquisition while using immersive technologies. To lay the foundation for disentangling the processes underlying recognition memory, we demonstrated the feasibility of capturing oscillations in the high-frequency gamma-band range (30-100Hz) in VR in a second study.

In particular, distinct functional properties of perceptual and mnemonic processing have been observed between conventional two-dimensional and realistic virtual three-dimensional environments, whereas these processes have not yet been investigated under real-life conditions. To determine the influence of different degrees of reality on cognitive processing, we investigated neuronal correlates of object perception and memory processing under conventional laboratory, realistic virtual and real-life conditions in two sessions.

To facilitate this practice, we reviewed and examined the accuracy of old and new ways to compute reliability in reaction time (RT) tasks. Using simulated data, we revealed that highly inaccurate reliability estimates are obtained by the common practice of averaging sets of trials and submitting them to Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Accurate reliability estimates were instead obtained by computing many random split-halves and aggregating the resulting correlations between both halves. Reliability estimation was further improved by ensuring each split-half contained an approximately equal number of trials for each stimulus. A further analysis revealed that autocorrelation, a common feature of reaction time tasks, can make reliability estimates larger than they should be under specific conditions. Specifically, autocorrelation always inflated the reliability of a simple RT average, and it inflated the reliability of difference scores in experimental designs where the conditions whose average RTs are contrasted were divided into separate blocks. Lastly, we examined the minimal number of split-halves that need to be averaged together to obtain a stable reliability estimate, finding a minimum of almost 9000 splits for median-based scores computed from the common sample size of 30 participants and 256 trials, whereas almost 7000 were required for mean-based scores given the same numbers of participants and trials.

To this end, we replicated a landmark fMRI study investigating the effect of reward on long-term memory, where participants memorised images preceded by cues showing different amounts of reward, which were paid out for later correctly recognising the stimuli in a delayed test. We validated and improved the behavioural paradigm in three large-scale online experiments (N = 200, N = 205, N = 187). These data provided a precise and reliable estimate of the expected behavioural effect size, facilitating sample size calculations for the fMRI study. In addition, our results show that the interpretation of previous data on the effect of rewards for long-term memory is likely incomplete inasmuch as reward-stimulus associations contribute as much or more to reward effects on hit rate as a potential reward related facilitation of image encoding.

In this Registered Report (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EQ9JD), we developed two novel behavioral tasks based on computational models that operationalize habits by the frequency of past behavior. We also included four previously used tasks and all three currently available self-report questionnaires of real-life habits to test the validity of all behavioral tasks. Extended testing of 220 participants on each of five consecutive days in the lab and an additional online session produced the most comprehensive dataset of habitual behavior to date. All data, code, and material have been publicly shared (https://osf.io/qjwht/) to encourage secondary analyses. Linear mixed-effects models and computational modeling of choice behavior revealed that past choice frequency influenced current choice and response time in addition to and independently of reinforcement.

Importantly, current paradigms fail to differentiate whether habits result from deficits in goal-directed control or an overactive habit system. To overcome this, our study uses electroencephalography (EEG) to identify neural markers distinguishing between these two forms of behavioral control. Participants (N=35) underwent both minimal (1-day) and extensive (14-day) training sessions, where they learned to associate stimuli with key presses. Following these sessions, half of the stimulus-response pairings were reversed. In the test phase, response preparation times were manipulated: long preparation trials facilitate accurate performance of new mappings, while short preparation trials increase the likelihood of habitual errors consistent with the old mapping. EEG was recorded during both the training and test phases. As predicted, extensive training led to increased habitual errors compared to minimal training, particularly evident during short preparation times. I will present EEG findings highlighting the neural correlates of the underlying processes and how they relate to habitual errors. Frontal-midline theta (FM\u03b8) activity is proposed as the index for goal-directed control, while the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) is proposed to quantify habitual response preparation. By establishing neural signatures of both goal-directed and habitual control, we aim to explore how they interact and are influenced by individual differences.

Often, however, our behavior is not as variable as we would assume. Instead, there is a high likelihood that our current response will equal the response we gave on the last previous occurrence of the very same stimulus. This principle is captured in the law of recency (Giesen et al., 2020), which posits that action control processes often rely on retrieval of previous stimulus-response (SR) episodes from memory. Episodic retrieval will activate the response that was executed during the most recent episode in which the stimulus was presented before. Within the present talk, we will first provide evidence that recency retrieval of SR episodes explains a large part of color-word contingency learning (CL) effects. Still, after controlling for recency retrieval, a residual CL effect remains, which reflects the impact of global contingencies on behavior. Hence, in a second step, we will present data in which we tested the influence of contingency awareness on this residual CL effect by giving true or false instructions about the existing color-word contingencies. We found that the residual CL effect is modulated by awareness, as true (false) instructions amplified (reduced) the residual CL effect. Collectively, our findings suggest that color-word contingency learning is driven by two independent sources: (1) recency-based episodic retrieval which emerges by mere spatial temporal contiguity, and (2) application of contingency knowledge."}}, "125": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-2", "SessionStart": "16:15:00", "SessionEnd": "17:45:00", "TalkStart": "17:15:00", "TalkEnd": "17:35:00", "Talk": "Down the habit hole: Where habitual and goal-directed control of behavior meet", "Speaker": "Angela Brands", "Chair": "Stephan Nebe, Lieneke K.

Participants from the GD group showed significantly lower task performance as well as diverging patterns in reaction times compared to the MC group, which was associated with dampened sensitivity to task contingencies. A well-established computational model extended to also account for higher order perseveration provided the best fit for both groups. Modelling results confirmed clearly reduced MB control in the GD group but further pointed to differences in habitual responding and reward guided behaviour at the second stage of the task. Analyses of the fMRI data are pending, and will test the prediction that impaired MB control in GD is linked to attenuated prefrontal control mechanisms. Current results mirror and extend previous research efforts, as they replicate reduced MB control in GD, but further allowing for a more detailed insight into additional underlying computational mechanisms at play and neural signatures associated with them.

For this purpose, psychosocial stress induction paradigms like ScanSTRESS are used, which systematically manipulate stress-eliciting key-components such as social-evaluative threat, negative feedback, and forced failure. Recently, it has been suggested that these components elicit distinct responses in the triple network, involving in particular structures of the salience and default mode network, but less those of the central executive network. Considering n = 500 ScanSTRESS data sets, the first mega-analysis in the context of stress imaging, performed with HALFpipe, showed that all structures of the triple network are involved in psychosocial stress processing, with the exception of the amygdala. This core region of the salience network showed increased activations only when individual cortisol increases were considered as a predictor for neural stress responses. This association between amygdala and cortisol stress response also exhibited a sex-specific pattern with positive associations between cortisol response and deactivations of the amygdala in men, but with activations of the amygdala in women. On this basis, for a sub-sample of n = 300 subjects it was further investigated, if structure- and task-based brain measures of the amygdala and other limbic structures like the hippocampus, rostral anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex can predict response trajectories of acute psycho-endocrine stress processing from baseline through acute to recovery phase.

Data were analyzed using Bayesian multivariate models. We found that EOtC students exhibited more efficient regulation of biological stress-reactivity and show a reduction of cortisol over the day associated with light PA in the forest.

Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), moderate acute psychosocial stress was induced with the imaging stress paradigm ScanSTRESS. Anxiety but not depression scores were significantly associated with neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, sex-specific differences favoring men were found in striatal and temporal clusters. A bifactor model of the HADS suggested a general psychological load factor, which was associated with similar regions as anxiety but being more constricted. In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS has been assessed at five sampling points (one year, three months, one week before the exam and one week, one month thereafter) and thus an exploratory trajectory-analysis using general linear models could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across timepoints. Our findings suggest that - in healthy young participants - neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety but not with depression scores.

Reviews and meta-analyses suggest that resilience is the most common response to exposure to adversity and stressors, making it an important outcome variable for psychophysiological stress research. This presentation discusses the use of a psychological stressor reactivity score to quantify mental resilience and as a potential prediction target for biomarkers of physiological stress reactivity. We recently proposed the calculation of a stressor reactivity score as an approximate estimate of mental resilience. This method first derives the normative stressor reactivity of a given sample as the positive relationship between stressor exposure and mental health problems. Individual stressor reactivity scores are then calculated as the deviation from this normative relationship via residualisation, and controlling for individual differences in stressor exposure. Thus, lower scores indicate an individual with lower than normative reactivity, and higher scores indicate greater than normative reactivity. A normatively positive relationship between stressor exposure and mental health problems is consistently found across multiple study populations and self-report methods. Stressor reactivity scores can thus be derived, and successfully control for within- and between-subject variation in stressor exposure. Individual stressor reactivity is predicted by relevant psychosocial resilience factors. The stressor reactivity score quantifies psychological stress responses via normative modelling and relative to individual stressor exposure. It is a promising and potentially more robust prediction target for physiological measures of stress reactivity for example compared to direct self-report of perceived stress."}}, "130": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-3", "SessionStart": "16:15:00", "SessionEnd": "17:45:00", "TalkStart": "17:15:00", "TalkEnd": "17:30:00", "Talk": "Central nervous biomarkers of stress and resilience in the lab and in everyday life: Predictions and considerations ", "Speaker": "Meike D.

Here, we investigated whether intra-individual development of adolescents\u2019 psychosocial functioning in response to environmental adversity is linked to ongoing myeloarchitectural maturation and downstream effects on functional reorganization. We operationalized resilient outcomes as comparatively lower levels of psychosocial distress than predicted from stressor exposure (including adverse life events, family settings, and socioeconomic status). This machine learning approach provided continuous resilience scores adjusted for variations in stressor exposure at different time points. We then extracted intra-cortical myeloarchitectural profiles from myelin-sensitive imaging to capture myelination and depth-dependent trajectories of systems-level synchronization. Our findings suggest that developing towards more resilient psychosocial functioning is linked to a higher rate of prefrontal myelination alongside stabilized functional connectivity within abstract cognitive networks. Moreover, we observed stronger cortex-wide myeloarchitectural reorganization of association cortices, paralleled by attenuated functional change. Conversely, adolescents who became more susceptible to stressors exhibited maturational trajectories more closely tied to earlier stages of adolescence, as well as decreasing prefrontal connectivity.

Accordingly, the main event-related potential (ERP) candidates for neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) are the early visual awareness negativity (VAN) and the late positivity (LP). Another central question is whether perceptual awareness is a graded or an all-or-none phenomenon. Recent studies have demonstrated that both VAN and LP gradually increase with the level of awareness. However, they systematically confounded conscious perception with task-related post-perceptual processes (e.g., decision-making). The present study investigated neural correlates of gradual awareness in the absence of decision-making. Awareness was manipulated using the attentional blink (AB), where conscious perception of a first visual target (T1) impairs reporting a second target (T2) presented in rapid succession. Decision-making processes at the time of T2 presentation were impeded by omitting a discrimination task on T2 stimuli and rendering their relevance uncertain. Importantly, unlike in no-report studies with limited awareness assessment, participants reported the subjective visibility of T2 using a four-level perceptual awareness scale (PAS) in each trial. The analysis of T2-locked ERPs as a function of subjective visibility revealed that awareness was associated with a VAN and \u2013 in contrast to a LP \u2013 a late centroparietal negativity. Moreover, both early and late negativities gradually increased with the level of awareness. Thus, our results support the VAN and challenge the LP as NCC and suggest that both early and late awareness-related brain activity occurs in a gradual rather than dichotomous manner."}}, "132": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Symposia 6-4", "SessionStart": "16:15:00", "SessionEnd": "17:45:00", "TalkStart": "16:30:00", "TalkEnd": "16:45:00", "Talk": "Neural correlates of conscious experience: progress and challenges", "Speaker": "Darinka Tr\u00fcbutschek", "Chair": "Torge Dellert", "Inhalt": "Autor Torge Dellert\n\nHow does our brain generate consciousness, that is, our subjective experience of what it is like to see or feel?

How exactly our brain generates this conscious experience has become a matter of rigorous research and intense scientific debate. According to influential models, conscious perception requires the active working-memory-like maintenance of information via synchronous thalamocortical activity, cortical recurrence, or the sustained recruitment of parieto-prefrontal areas in a global neuronal workspace. Non-conscious perception, on the flip-side, is short-lived, with non-conscious stimuli rarely affecting behavior or brain responses beyond a couple hundred milliseconds. I will present behavioral, eye-tracking, and magnetoencephalography evidence questioning these widely-held assumptions. Combining a spatial-delayed response paradigm with visual masking, in several experiments, we show that (i) non-conscious information may be maintained for several seconds, (ii) this long-lasting blindsight effect possesses several features characteristic of working memory, and (iii) it may even support longer-term learning of statistical dependencies. Unlike its conscious counterpart, however, this non-conscious \u2018working\u2019 memory is not accompanied by sustained neural activity, but might rely on slowly decaying, \u2018activity-silent\u2019 changes in synaptic weights of cell assemblies coding for remembered content.

In this paradigm, participants performed a visual distractor task with line stimuli presented in the background, which sometimes contained an abstract human face for either 500 or 1000 ms. Half of the participants were informed of the presence of the face, resulting in faces being perceived by the informed but not by the uninformed participants. Using our new stimulus in an EEG experiment (N = 62), we investigated how prolonged stimulus durations modulate the visual awareness negativity (VAN), a typically transient enhanced negative ERP in response to consciously seen versus unseen stimuli in occipitotemporal electrodes. Our results provide evidence for a sustained visual awareness negativity (SVAN) that appears to correspond to the temporal representation of a visual percept beyond its initial onset. We also present first results from an fMRI experiment using our novel stimulus. Our analysis comprises a direct comparison of longer and shorter stimulus presentations in the awareness contrasts.

Across two studies, we probed the neural dynamics linked to sustained visual presentation and the dynamics of the associated conscious experience. In the first study, we manipulated stimulus duration (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5s) while measuring brain activation with high spatio-temporal resolution using invasive EEG. We found that posterior cortex activation was coupled with duration, while prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited only transient activation at stimulus onset. In the second study, we investigated the coupling between experience and presentation dynamics, leveraging the psychological refractory period (PRP), defined as a delay in reaction time (RT) to a stimulus when presented in close succession to another. We presented auditory stimuli locked to the onset or offset of visual stimuli, predicting that a PRP effect would be observed if these events were consciously experienced. A delay in RT was observed for both events, suggesting coupling between experience and presentation dynamics, though the offset effect was absent for short visual stimuli. Combined, our results challenge the role of PFC as an NCC candidate. However, the lack of a PRP effect on short trials suggests that temporal coupling may not be systematic.

Participants (n=34) received pairs of brief electrical pulses with variable inter-stimulus intervals to the left median nerve and a simultaneous visual cue indicating either \u201cone\u201d or \u201ctwo\u201d pulses. To control for confounding processes such as motor responses, rather than directly reporting their experience, participants indicated via saccades whether they experienced a match or mismatch between their tactile experience and the visual cue. Using event-related potentials and source reconstruction, we investigated modulations of post-stimulus activity by the experience of perceiving one vs. two pulses. The ERP analysis revealed a fronto-central difference around 145 ms between \u201cfelt as one\u201d and \u201cfelt as two\u201d trials. This effect occurred as part of a P165 component.

Dipole time courses confirmed that only the dipole pair in bilateral SI could reproduce the sensor level effect.

While most neuroimaging research on schemas uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), little is known about the oscillatory signatures obtained from electrophysiological recordings involved in processing and representing schematic information. Therefore, we obtained oscillatory power measured from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) while participants repeatedly encoded and retrieved six audio-visual movies. The movies were either set in a supermarket or a restaurant (schema context), and within each schema context one movie strongly followed the typical events associated with the schema, one movie only followed it weakly, and one movie did not contain typical schematic events (schema strength). Behaviorally, schema-related memory processing was evident such that higher schema strength led to more false recall of details consistent with the movie\u2019s underlying schema, indicating overgeneralization in situations that are highly consistent with stored schematic knowledge. Schema context elicited reliable and generalizable representations during all encoding repetitions. These representations were reinstated in free recall, reflected in activity in alpha and beta frequency in frontally distributed channels.

By leveraging intuitions about regularities in the spatial composition of other airports, certain schemas may seem more likely than others. Understanding the meaning of the whole based on the parts and the way they are syntactically combined is known as \"compositionality\", and is argued to be a unique feature of human cognition, distinguishing us from other animals and AI. However, seemingly contradictory implications arise: is compositionality cheap or costly? On the one hand, compositionality allows for simpler and more compact programs, but on the other hand, the combinatorial explosion of hypothesis space makes search exceedingly difficult. Here, we use time pressure to manipulate the availability of cognitive resources in a compositional maze task, to better understand the costs of compositional hypothesis generation. A hidden path is described using a compositional grammar formed from spatial primitives, with participants asked to navigate to the goal with as few wrong moves as possible. While time pressure led to more random errors, it did not impair a preference for testing hypotheses with greater compositional structure, suggesting it is more robust and cheap than previously expected. Our winning model accounts for this bias based on the creative re-use of previously observed structure, providing a complementary perspective to recent approaches using program induction requiring costly inference.

Our modeling results indicate that participants could abstract the underlying latent reward structure and generalize over states sharing the same reward contingencies. Furthermore, participants applied their relational knowledge and abstracted reward contingencies to correctly infer reward values of states that they never directly experienced. fMRI adaptation analysis results indicate separate representations of the underlying structure and reward contingency in the hippocampal-formation and vmPFC.

Drawing on multimodal brain imaging data and behavioral evidence, this symposium presents new evidence on how schemas guide human behavior and allow us to generalize to new experiences. The first two talks will focus on how cognitive schemas shape behavioral choices: Katja Kleespies will show that prior knowledge influences what we remember from everyday-like experiences, like visiting a supermarket or going to a restaurant, and that schema-related brain activity guides memory encoding and retrieval. Charley Wu will then demonstrate that we use complex compositional strategies to navigate such contexts, drawing on fragments of existing schemas to solve novel tasks, even under time pressure. The following speakers will shed light on how regularities are inferred from new experiences: Nico Schuck will show that both the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex are involved in generalizing event structures across different environments. Felix Deilmann will present evidence that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex represent distinct types of relational information, predictive contingencies between objects and the associated reward structure, and how we can generalize contingencies between these dimensions.

To do so, we draw both on our explicit knowledge of past experiences as well as our implicit understanding of the rules that govern our environment. These two sources of knowledge are supported by complementary learning and memory systems: An explicit memory system mediated by the hippocampus and an implicit memory system that is associated with striatal circuits. Sleep has been suggested as one potential mechanism that mediates the complementary influences of explicit vs. implicit memories on behavior. Here, we trained participants on a feedback-driven categorization task in which they had to choose the winner item in a series of object comparisons. The task could be solved by explicitly remembering individual exemplars or by inferring the implicit information integration rule that determined the object hierarchy. We find that sleep resolves competition between memory representations from these disparate sources to support both explicit memory as well as rule-based inferences. Participants who slept after training exhibited a better cooperative use of implicit and explicit knowledge, as well as better rule-transfer abilities in an inference task. Patterns of brain activity mirror these results: the sleep group showed stronger activity in the hippocampus during rule inference and stronger activity in the striatum during exemplar recall. Sleep may thus help us to optimally combine information acquired in multiple memory systems to support flexible behavior."}}}}}}, "poster": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Poster Session 2", "SessionStart": "14:30:00", "SessionEnd": "16:00:00", "TalkStart": "nan", "TalkEnd": "nan", "Talk": "nan", "Speaker": "nan", "Chair": "nan", "Inhalt": "nan", "Uni": "nan", "Abstract": "nan"}, "keynote": {"Tag": "Freitag", "Session": "Keynote 2", "SessionStart": "13:30:00", "SessionEnd": "14:30:00", "TalkStart": "nan", "TalkEnd": "nan", "Talk": "nan", "Speaker": "nan", "Chair": "nan", "Inhalt": "nan", "Uni": "nan", "Abstract": "nan"}}, "Samstag": {"symposia": {"session7": {"session7-1": {"Index": "S31", "Talk": "From Brain Mapping to Behavior: Multimodal Insights into TMS Effects", "Title": "S31 - From Brain Mapping to Behavior: Multimodal Insights into TMS Effects", "DatePlace": "Samstag 09:00 - 10:30 | Ort TODO", "Chair": {"author": " Ole Numssen, Sandra Martin", "uni": "MR Center of Excellence, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "Mantel": "This symposium on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) addresses the urgent need to deepen our understanding of TMS effects on the brain, particularly given the substantial intra- and inter-individual variability in responses.

Here, we introduce state-of-the-art forward models for EEG source modelling, generated via SimNIBS-CHARM. Using these alongside TMS-induced electric field models, we investigate various aspects of the negative 15 peak (N15), one of the earliest TMS-EEG responses, in 16 healthy adults. Our findings reveal spatial discordance between the N15 source field and the TMS-induced electric field, although both were localised in the left motor regions. Furthermore, the magnitude of the N15 source field varies based on the subject's state (resting vs. active motor state) and TMS dose affects both magnitude and location. While the N15 source strongly correlates with TMS-generated motor evoked potentials, our results underscore that N15 primarily reflects cortical excitability rather than corticospinal excitability, emphasising its suitability to investigate the central nervous system. Also, exploratory analyses indicate that TMS dose effects are modulated by the T1/T2 ratio, a readily accessible indicator of cortical myelination.

Temporal stability of conditioned responses was assessed using SCR and BOLD fMRI using a representational similarity analysis (RSA)-related approach. We thereby investigated whether an individual's baseline responses were more similar to their own (within-subject similarity) or to those of others (between-subject similarity) at the 6-month follow-up. Mostly, SCRs of one individual at baseline were not more similar to responses of the same individual at follow-up than compared to others at follow-up indicating limited temporal stability across 6 months. However, for BOLD fMRI, within-subject similarity was significantly higher compared to between-subject similarity during acquisition, but not extinction. It will be discussed whether these results indicate that BOLD fMRI may be more stable over time than SCRs at an individual level or whether RSA-inspired approaches might be more sensitive to detecting BOLD fMRI individual-level similarity compared to that of SCRs.

For instance, they manifest along internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety, eating disorders) and externalizing spectra (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder). Yet, only a few studies exist investigating the genetic architecture of these dimensions as well as their associated genetically predicted risk and protective factors. Methods: To estimate the latent internalizing and externalizing dimensions, we used genomic structural equation modeling with genome-wide association study summary data for individual disorders from these spectra. The genetic information of the latent dimensions served two purposes: a) elucidating their biological underpinnings by a tissue expression enrichment analysis, and b) evaluating the causal relationship among various risk factors on these dimensions through Mendelian Randomization. The risk factors included vitamin D, alcohol consumption, childhood maltreatment, and self-reported physical activity. Results: Indices from the common factor models indicated a good model fit, with moderate to strong loadings of individual disorders on the internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Genetically predicted childhood maltreatment (OR=2.64; 95%-CI: 1.52-4.60; P=5.80x10-04) and alcohol consumption (OR=1.51; 95%-CI: 1.32-1.74; P=6.13x10-09) were consistently associated with the externalizing dimension across various sensitivity analyses. For the internalizing dimension, childhood maltreatment (OR=1.60; 95%-CI: 1.04-2.48; P=0.035) and physical activity (OR=0.79; 95%-CI: 0.65-0.96; P=0.015) revealed significant causal relationships.

METHODS: Our analysis involved 19,183 participants drawn from the UK Biobank imaging cohort. Depression status and adverse life experiences were determined through questionnaire data, while genetic susceptibility to depression was quantified using polygenic scores. We assessed the integrity of 27 white matter tracts by analyzing mean fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Individuals displaying depressive symptoms exhibited reduced white matter integrity, particularly noticeable in thalamic and intracortical fiber tracts, regardless of their current symptom severity. In a cohort of non-depressed individuals, heightened genetic predisposition and increased exposure to adverse life events correlated with decreased integrity in relevant fiber tracts, particularly within thalamic radiations. Notably, this association surpassed what would be expected based solely on statistical correlations between samples, a finding corroborated by subsequent in silico simulations and permutation tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that alterations in white matter integrity within thalamic and association tracts are linked to both depressive symptoms and genetic susceptibility to depression in individuals not currently affected by the condition.

From an information-theoretical perspective, the consolidation process during sleep should reduce neural pattern variability. Here, in a cross-species study, we found a tradeoff in the neural population code during sleep, with the neocortex displaying higher information coding efficiency compared to the archicortex, humans compared to rodents, and wakefulness compared to sleep. Critically, non-REM sleep specifically decreases information coding efficiency in the neocortex, likely reflecting neural pattern recapitulation. The hippocampus however shows a consistent but more redundant population code across sleep stages. These results support the neocortex's role in long-term memory storage. Moreover, task engagement enhances coding efficiency, while induced unconsciousness disrupts the population code.

The stable and lasting consolidation of the modified memory is essential for the success of the therapy. Fundamental research has shown that processes of memory consolidation take place primarily during sleep. This consolidation can be optimized by the presentation of memory cues. This study investigated whether the effect of ImRs can be further enhanced by nocturnal exposure to odour cues that have already been presented during the ImRs sessions. Methods: Patients received 12 ImR-sessions during which an odour was presented. In the nights between therapy sessions, patients were presented with either the same odour (congruent condition) or a new odour (congruent condition). The main outcome measure was PTSD-symptoms assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 at 1-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial functioning, trauma-associated cognitions as well as subjective and objective sleep quality. Results: Patients showed an improvement in PTSD-symptoms and secondary outcomes. Preliminary results of the first data show a trend towards faster and greater improvement of symptoms in the congruent condition.

Hence, the present study aimed to show if and how sound localization is influenced by bimodal odorant stimulation. Participants completed a dynamic sound localization paradigm in which they were presented with a sequence of sounds at varying locations. After each sound, participants made a two-alternative forced choice judgment, indicating its spatial location (left vs. right). Critically, in a subset of occasions, but unbeknown to the participants, the sounds were presented at a central location, creating a situation of maximal spatial uncertainty. Furthermore, in the first half of the sound sequence, sound presentation could be accompanied by a task-irrelevant bimodal odorant stimulation (i.e., isopropanol) in the left, right, or both nostrils. In addition, odorant-free auditory-only trials served as a baseline condition. Under conditions of high spatial uncertainty (i.e., central sounds), the proportion of right-ward responses increased with right-nostril odorant stimulation but decreased with left-nostril stimulation (relative to the two control conditions). This effect was only present in the second half of the sound sequence, suggesting an after-effect of odorant-stimulation. Confirming the successful manipulation of spatial attention, we observed a significant lateralization of posterior alpha-band power in response to a physically non-lateralized sound. Notably, attentional orienting towards strongly lateralized (+/- 15\u00b0 azimuth) sounds in the sequence was disturbed by incongruent odorant-stimulation (e.g., left-sided sound and right-nostril odorant stimulation), as reflected in reduced alpha power lateralization. In sum, the present study demonstrates a chemosensory-sound ventriloquism effect and its neurophysiological underpinnings."}}, "159": {"Tag": "Samstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 7-5", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:20:00", "TalkEnd": "09:40:00", "Talk": "Neurocognitive mechanisms of cognitive flexibility and attention allocation ", "Speaker": "Philipp Musfeld", "Chair": "Laura Klatt, Anna-Lena Schubert", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Laura Klatt, Anna-Lena Schubert\n\nThe symposium focuses on cognitive flexibility, a vital skill for navigating the complexities of dynamic environments.

Critical to this process is the learning of regularities and repeated patterns in our environment to optimize cognitive resource allocation. Learning such patterns from repeated exposure is often construed as an example of implicit learning, wherein memory representations passively strengthen with each encounter of a repeatedly presented pattern. Here, we tested this assumption using both behavioral and EEG measures. Participants were presented with 150 visual patterns, with two patterns repeated approximately every fifth trial. On each trial, we measured 1) working memory performance, indicating the amount of information which could be maintained over a short time interval, 2) participants' recognition of pattern repetitions, and 3) recorded EEG during stimulus encoding. Behavioral results revealed that working memory performance improved only after participants had recognized a repeated pattern. Additionally, recognition of pattern repetition strongly correlated with the emergence of the P600, an ERP component associated with explicit memory retrieval processes. Yet, this signature manifested only after participants reported awareness of the repetition; prior to repetition awareness, ERPs were indistinguishable from unrepeated patterns, and no benefit in working memory performance was observed. These findings are inconsistent with the assumption of implicit learning mechanisms and suggest that repetition learning necessitates explicit retrieval of previous encounters from episodic memory to initiate the formation of stable long-term memories."}}, "160": {"Tag": "Samstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 7-5", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "09:40:00", "TalkEnd": "10:00:00", "Talk": "Neurocognitive mechanisms of cognitive flexibility and attention allocation ", "Speaker": "Jan G\u00f6ttmann", "Chair": "Laura Klatt, Anna-Lena Schubert", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Laura Klatt, Anna-Lena Schubert\n\nThe symposium focuses on cognitive flexibility, a vital skill for navigating the complexities of dynamic environments.

Mathematical models can address this issue, as they are capable of mapping processes of interest with parameters that are mathematically derived from hypotheses about the nature of these latent processes. The Memory Measurement Model framework (M3; Oberauer & Lewandowsky, 2018) consists of a collection of such cognitive measurement models that isolate parameters associated with distinct working memory processes, such as the formation of bindings or the filtering of irrelevant distractors, in widely used paradigms like simple or complex span tasks. Based on simulations, we developed a series of experiments for different stimulus modalities, tailored to estimate the parameters of the M3 complex span models and to be concurrently used for electrophysiological research. We demonstrate that the estimated model parameters are related to specific neurocognitive correlates indicative of working memory target and distractor processing as well as attention allocation, like the P300 and the contingent negative variation (CNV). We will discuss how this neurocognitive psychometric approach enables more precise measurement of individual differences in different aspects of working memory processes."}}, "161": {"Tag": "Samstag", "Session": "Symposia Session 7-5", "SessionStart": "09:00:00", "SessionEnd": "10:30:00", "TalkStart": "10:00:00", "TalkEnd": "10:20:00", "Talk": "Neurocognitive mechanisms of cognitive flexibility and attention allocation ", "Speaker": "Anna-Lena Schubert", "Chair": "Laura Klatt, Anna-Lena Schubert", "Inhalt": "Autoren: Laura Klatt, Anna-Lena Schubert\n\nThe symposium focuses on cognitive flexibility, a vital skill for navigating the complexities of dynamic environments.

This supports the notion that more intelligent individuals benefit from the adaptive modulation of theta-band synchronization during information processing, highlighting the role of interregional goal-directed processing in cognitive control and intelligence (Schubert et al., 2021). Here we present a conceptual replication and extension of these studies in a sample of 148 participants from the general population. These participants underwent EEG recording while completing three distinct cognitive flexibility tasks, designed to dissociate the shifting of task and response sets from actual task execution. This methodological variation aimed to elucidate the dynamics of cognitive control in varying contexts. Individual differences in global frontal midline theta connectivity were correlated across the three tasks, suggesting that global frontal midline theta connectivity is a neurocognitive measure of cognitive control capable of reflecting an underlying latent trait. Using a chronometric structural equation modeling approach, we corroborated the strong relationship between frontal midline theta connectivity and human intelligence, particularly during stages of higher-order information processing. Importantly, we observed a larger correlation when participants actually engaged in tasks involving new response sets compared to when they only shifted their attention towards these new response sets prior to task execution. These findings extend existing research, indicating that more intelligent individuals benefit from an adaptive modulation of global network dynamics particularly during phases of stimulus evaluation and response formation."}}}}}}, "poster": {}, "keynote": {"Tag": "Samstag", "Session": "Keynote 3", "SessionStart": "12:00:00", "SessionEnd": "13:00:00", "TalkStart": "nan", "TalkEnd": "nan", "Talk": "nan", "Speaker": "nan", "Chair": "nan", "Inhalt": "nan", "Uni": "nan", "Abstract": "nan"}}}
